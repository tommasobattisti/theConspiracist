The selected texts has been chosen among authoritative articles aiming at analyzing conspiracies from differnet points of view and the souces can be found in the <a href="./disclaimer.html">disclaimer</a>. in particular, the issue where the texts are contained focuses on the Pizzagate conspiracy theory and, therefore, containes only articles and book-chapters dealing with this topic. This choice has been made so to provide the users with the possibility of comparing documents with references to similar entities.</p>
                <p>The entities we decided to highlight are the ones that made more sense to focus on given the topic, named people, places, organizations, events and concepts. Moreover, also general keywords without a specific refrence to the entity type can be added and highlighted.</p>
                <p>The website presents the possibility to change between different historically-inspired typographic styles and, in the issue section, the one of annotating and highlight keywords and entities. Furthermore, it is possible to choose between the single text and the comparison view to analyze the documents in the preferred way. In the comparison mode, metadata and entities-related fetures can be accessed by means of a modal, which can be activated by a button on the right side that appears only in two cases: when the user is in the comparison mode and when the screen is not enough wide to display the single-text-modal in a suitable way.</p>

                        We believe that the design and layout of the 40s were truly elegant and timeless, 
                        and we aim to re-discover the elegance of this period through this style.
                        In order to do that, we decided to take inspiration from the Time magazine of these years,
                        which has been, and it is still today, one of the most successfull magazines of all times.
                        The history of the Time begins in the 1922, when:
                        <blockquote>
                            two young Yale University graduates, Briton Hadden and Henry Robinson Luce, 
                            rented the parlor floor of an old house at 141 East 17th Street in New York for $55 a month, bought some tables 
                            and chairs for a total of $48.70, and sat down to write a prospectus for a new weekly newsmagazine to be called, 
                            after considerable reflection, Time.

                    <p>
                        <span class="time-title-paragraph">Time General Layout.</span>
                        The layout and design of "Time" magazine during the 40s made use of clean and simple lines, but with a strong focus on 
                        typography. The headlines were large and bold, set in serif typefaces, with a clear hierarchy of information strengthen also by means
                        of sans-serif subtitles and by in-paragraph subsections titles, displayed in the same sans-serif font.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The body copy was set in a legible serif typeface, and the use of black and white photographs was prominent, 
                        with selective use of spot color to highlight key elements. Additionally, the "Time" started to add during these years 
                        also some paintings and illustrations. These choices, with respect to colors, have been adapted in the style by means of
                        hover effects on images and illustrations, which are generally displayed in black and white, and take back their original 
                        colors when the mouse is over them. 
                        The overall design was heavily influenced by the Bauhaus, characterized it with simplicity and functionality, features that have been 
                        reflected in this style.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finally, the iconic cover of the "Time" magazine during the 1940s had a strong visual impact, 
                        often featuring a single photograph or illustration as the main focal point, accompanied by bold typography. 
                        The cover design was simple and clean, with a strong emphasis on the use 
                        of typography, using a limited color palette, mainly made of black, white and red.
                        All these information
                        have been gathered from <a href="https://pyimagesearch.com/2015/10/19/analyzing-91-years-of-time-magazine-covers-for-visual-trends/">here</a>.

                    <p>
                        The stylistic choices connected to fonts and colors have been re-adapted where possible. In this way we aim to arouse sensations that could bring 
                        back in time the user, transmitting the vintage and elegant feelings that were transmitted by the original copies of the magazine. Additionally,
                        we tried to re-adapt the iconic cover of the Time to the new media, by removing the focal point and leaving more space to
                        the typographic presentation of a sections. This is mainly due to the adaptation needed for the vast majority of devices, with the horizontal
                        orientation of the screen.

                        <span class="time-title-paragraph">Time: Font and colors adaptations.</span>
                        The palette used for the adaptation of the magazine is primarily black and white, with shades of gray and occasional use of spot colors, 
                        in particular for images, illustrations, and for the margins of the various pages. The latter, try to arouse the feeling of the 
                        iconic cover. Additionally, the use of minimal color is intentional, as it allows the content to take center stage.
                        Our stylistic choices for colors recalls the original color palette of the magazine, we have used the original brilliant red
                        of the cover, that we took from <a href="https://www.colourlovers.com/color/D62503/Time_Magazine_Red">here</a>, and the classical
                        black and white of the magazine.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For what concerns the fonts, we have used the same typeface used by the original magazine for the main titles, that is the serif 
                        '<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cinzel?query=cinzel">Cinzel</a>',
                        as stated <a href="https://letroot.com/time-magazine-font-free-download/">here</a>, and we have used other two fonts 
                        to resemble the original typographic hieraarchy of the magazines. These latter are not the original fonts used by the Time,
                        but are pretty coherent adaptations of them:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                the '<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Sofia+Sans+Condensed?query=sofia+sans">Sofia Sans Extra Condensed</a>' is our
                                choiche for the sans-serif sub-sections and sections titles,
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                and the '<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Crimson+Text?query=crimson+">Crimson Text</a>' has been used as 
                                the only serif font for the body copy.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The magazine also featured a consistent grid system, which helped to create a cohesive and organized overall design. 
                        The grid system was divided into columns and rows, with strict margins and a clear visual hierarchy of elements.
                        Also this choice has been re-adapted to the new medium in a way that allows a grid-like organization of the space, 
                        but with a more flexible and responsive layout made by columns and flexbox.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For what concerns instead the various margins, we have decided to adopt the classical red, but also to add some 
                        squared containers made up of black and white alternated squares. These containers resemble the original containers
                        used in the cover of the magazine. Our choiche reflects this use of boxes in the covers, which are the presentation pages of 
                        the main sections of the website. We have also added these boxes to the Issue section, in particular to give a more dynamic
                        shape to the readings.
                        The dimensions of these borders (both the black and white squares, as well as the red borders) seemed to have no clear reference, thus 
                        we tried to respect them in the best possible way, but also to re-adapt these when necessary, for a better display of the contents.

                        We looked at some different editions of the magazine through the years, starting from the 1930 and ending in 1950.
                        The vast amount of visual references come from editions of the 40s, as the pages we display below:

                    <h3>Layout and visual characteristics</h3>
                    <p><span class="time-title-paragraph">Layout and visuals of Swiss.</span>In short, we can make a summary of the main charcreistics of the Swiss Grid System as follows:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Asymmetrical organization of the design elements on a grid to create Visual unity in a composition.</li>
                            <li>Clear and factual way of presenting visual and textual information, using objective photography and illustration, and ensuring that it filters any propaganda and the exaggerated claims of commercial advertising.</li>
                            <li>Using sans-serif typography set flush left, ragged right since <q cite="http://guity-novin.blogspot.com/2016/09/chapter-42-swiss-grid-system-and-dutch.html#One">The movement believed  sans-serif typography expressed the spirit of a progressive age</q>.</li>
                            <li>Consistent use of negative space.</li>
                            <li>Matte colour palettes.</li>
                            <li>Match of monstrous and tiny letters for accents, bold and thing letters to express mood, monochrome and vivid palette to add vibrancy.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>For what concerns layout, we decided to make the neative space a protagonist as much as the page content is according to Josef Müller-Brockmann's priciple stating that the background is an element of design on a par with the other elements (<cite>Grid systems in graphic design</cite>, page 20). Moreover, we tried to make the text as legible as possible according to these principles by trying to maintain the words per line between 7 and 10, and to try to make the columns width proportional to the size of the type, as suggested by Müller-Brockmann in the same book at page 30 and 31.</p>
                    <p>In dealing with margins, still according to Müller-Brockmann's principles, we opted for "well-proportioned margins [that] can enhance the pleasure of reading" (<cite>Grid systems in graphic design</cite>, page 39). In order to avoid errors we directly derived our proportions from what Müller-Brockmann suggests, meaning a left margin of 1 unit, an upper margin of 1.5, a right margin of 2 units, and a bottom margin of 3.</p>

                    <p><span class="time-title-paragraph">Font and colors from the 50s.</span>The coiche beneath the use of Helvetica Neue has been dictated by many factors. Even thogh it was created only in 1983, Helvetica Neue is a reworking of the well known Helvetica font created in 1957. The changes with respect to the latter are the more structurally unified set of heights and widths, the improved legibility and the heavier punctuation marks.</p>
                    <p>The scalability of Helvetica Neue gave us the possibility to improve easy reading, given by the font weight and size, and to produce clear contrasts, making the difference between texts width different dimension clearly recognizable.</p>
                    <p>The color palette we used is based on the <a href="https://fabianburghardt.de/swisscolors/">Swiss Style color picker</a>.</p>

                    <p>Spoiler: our time-machine widget is not so powerful to project us to the future in order to bring back some reality-based inspiration (we are sorry for that).</p>
                    <p>For obvious lacks of technological diffusion and availability, we were not able to construct a complete sensorial experience surrounding the user from different points of view. Therefore, our main priority remained the one of imagine and present what the (near) future could look like from a typographic and layout-related perspective, with a margin of citationism towards common fanta-scientific beliefs and cultural references.</p>

We made great use of negative spaces that inthis case are filled with the inverted background gradient of the above cited animation, which is used as color-background for the whole website.</p>
                    <p>The text is placed slightly on the left side of te webpage to let accomodate the eye of the user where normally the act of reading and writing in the western word starts, on the left indeed.

                    <p><span class="time-title-paragraph">Fonts and colors for future.</span>In this case we opted for two fonts. In particular, Orbitron has been choosen for the titles for its geometrical shapes and its declared aim of being an alternative to common sci-fi based and futuristic typefaces. Moreover, Exo has been chosen for longer texts for its legibility and its purpose of <q cite="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Exo/about?query=exo">convey a technological/futuristic feeling while keeping an elegant design</q>.</p>
                    <p>For what concerns colors, we decided to stick with the colors the animation came with because of the sense of peace they transmit. Still with the purpose of letting the user relax in front of the screen, we opted for avoiding shoking colors or too much contrasts. Therefore, we choose for the texts a dark lue and a violet with some transparency, preferring to convey the feeling of fluctuating over the surface of a distant planet made of milk and blueberries.</p>
