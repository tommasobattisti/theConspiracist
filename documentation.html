            <h2>Idea and website's features</h2>
            <p>The project has been deveoped for the final exam of the “Information Modelling and Web Technologies” couse of the master's degree in Digital Humaities and Digital Knowledge of the University of Bologna.</p>
            <p>the magazine's topic is a personal choice of the project's authors. The selected texts has been chosen among authoritative articles aiming at analyzing conspiracies from differnet points of view and the souces can be found in the <a href="./disclaimer.html">disclaimer</a>. in particular, the issue where the texts are contained focuses on the Pizzagate conspiracy theory and, therefore, containes only articles and book-chapters dealing with this topic. This choice has been made so to provide the users with the possibility of comparing documents with references to similar entities.</p>
            <p>The entities we decided to highlight are the ones that made more sense to focus on given the topic, named people, places, organizations, events and concepts. Moreover, also general keywords without a specific refrence to the entity type can be added and highlighted.</p>
            <p>The website presents the possibility to change between different historically-inspired typographic styles and, in the issue section, the one of annotating and highlight keywords and entities. Furthermore, it is possible to choose between the single text and the comparison view to analyze the documents in the preferred way. In the comparison mode, metadata and entities-related fetures can be accessed by means of a modal, which can be activated by a button on the right side that appears only in two cases: when the user is in the comparison mode and when the screen is not enough wide to display the single-text-modal in a suitable way.</p>

            <h2>1500</br>To latest incunabula and beyond!</h2>
                <p>Incunabula are</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>books printed during the earliest period of typography—i.e., from the invention of the art of typographic printing in Europe in the 1450s to the end of the 15th century (i.e., January 1501).</p>
                </blockquote>
                <cite>From<a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/incunabula">Encyclopedia Britannica</a></cite>
            <p>We decided to refer to this year as a year of "transition" from the incunabula-period to the principles that governed western printing to the late 18th century. in particular, we took inspiration from the typographic type of incunabula, which are the ones <q cite="http://guity-novin.blogspot.com/2012/04/modern-newspaper-magazine-layouts.html#Three">made with movable type on a printing press in the style of Johann Gutenberg</q> and, starting from here, we decided to adapt to the current medium the canonical structures governing the layut of books printed during the 16th century.</p>
            
            <p>It would have been difficult to grasp each detail of about an entire century of print and typographic history, also because <q cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incunable#Types">the spread of printing to cities both in the North and in Italy ensured that there was great variety in the texts and the styles which appeared.</q> Therefore, we decided to stick with the basic principles and the main features of these editions.</p>

            <h3>Layout</h3>
            We decided to mix a single column layout with the presence of a double column in some sub-sections adding, especially in the homepage, an ornametation on the left side of the text to achieve a more balanced composition. In fact, while 
            <blockquote>
                <p>Incunabula's layout designs still resembled the medieval compositions using classical ornamentation, initials and bordering but with a greater use of white space. The incunabula layout designers made a grater use of columns for aesthetical effects</p>
                <p>In the classical layout type was generally set in one justified column per page, placed symmetrically on the spread with larger outer margins than inner, and a larger margin at the foot than at the head.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>The classical proportions of various segments and margins were determined geometrically, using as a reference the Golden Rectangle, which provides the design its elegant mathematical balance. To achieve such an approximation on this website, we referred to the <q cite="http://guity-novin.blogspot.com/2012/04/modern-newspaper-magazine-layouts.html#Three">use of Fibonacci sequence to arrive at relative margin sizes (inner margin 3 units; top and outer margins 5 units; bottom margin 8 units)</q>. </p>
            <p>So, we positioned the texts toward the left side of the page, with a wider right-hand margin that aesthetically anchors the negative space of the page. In doing that we maintained only the above listed proportions, which have been multiplied by a constant in order to make the overall page layout more suited for a web page.</p>

            <h3>Font and clolor palette</h3>
            <p>For what concerns the typeface, we decided to provide the user with a pleasent reading experience avoiding Gothic typefaces even though they were the most used one especially at the time of incunabula, accounting for abput 80% of the editions. <q cite="https://www.ndl.go.jp/incunabula/e/chapter2/index.html">Roman type, meanwhile, accounts for 20% of all the types used in incunabula</q> and are the ones that are still pleasently readable nowadays.</p>
            <p>More specifically, we choose Inknut Antiqua, which is, according to its description, <q cite="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inknut+Antiqua/about">designed to evoke Venetian incunabula and humanist manuscripts, but with the quirks and idiosyncrasies of the kinds of typefaces you find in this artisanal tradition</q>.</p>
            <p>Finally, we choose the colors by making use of the "explore" section of <a href="https://color.adobe.com/it/search?q=incunabula&t=tag">Adobe Color</a> and the <b>BLABLABLA NON TROVO PIù IL SITO CON LA PALETTE http://www.colorhunter.com/tag/incunabula/1</b></p>

            <h2>1950</br>Grid is the answer</h2>

            <p>The Swiss Grid Style, or International Typographic Style, was maily developed in Switzerland during the 1950s. It is maily <q cite="http://guity-novin.blogspot.com/2016/09/chapter-42-swiss-grid-system-and-dutch.html#One">characterized by a cold, emotionally sterile grid style; they used structured layout, and unjustified type [... The graphic artists] searched for anonymous, objective visual communication. They chose photographic images rather than illustration, and typefaces that were industrial-looking rather than those designed for books.</q></p>
                
            <h3>Layout and visual characteristics</h3>
            <p>In short, we can make a summary of the main charcreistics of the Swiss Grid System as follows:
                <ul>
                    <li>Asymmetrical organization of the design elements on a grid to create Visual unity in a composition.</li>
                    <li>Clear and factual way of presenting visual and textual information, using objective photography and illustration, and ensuring that it filters any propaganda and the exaggerated claims of commercial advertising.</li>
                    <li>Using sans-serif typography set flush left, ragged right since <q cite="http://guity-novin.blogspot.com/2016/09/chapter-42-swiss-grid-system-and-dutch.html#One">The movement believed  sans-serif typography expressed the spirit of a progressive age</q>.</li>
                    <li>Consistent use of negative space.</li>
                    <li>Matte colour palettes.</li>
                    <li>Match of monstrous and tiny letters for accents, bold and thing letters to express mood, monochrome and vivid palette to add vibrancy.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>For what concerns layout, we decided to make the neative space a protagonist as much as the page content is according to Josef Müller-Brockmann's priciple stating that the background is an element of design on a par with the other elements (<cite>Grid systems in graphic design</cite>, page 20). Moreover, we tried to make the text as legible as possible according to these principles by trying to maintain the words per line between 7 and 10, and to try to make the columns width proportional to the size of the type, as suggested by Müller-Brockmann in the same book at page 30 and 31.</p>
            <p>In dealing with margins, still according to Müller-Brockmann's principles, we opted for "well-proportioned margins [that] can enhance the pleasure of reading" (<cite>Grid systems in graphic design</cite>, page 39). In order to avoid errors we directly derived our proportions from what Müller-Brockmann suggests, meaning a left margin of 1 unit, an upper margin of 1.5, a right margin of 2 units, and a bottom margin of 3.</p>

            </div>

            <h3>Font and colors</h3>
            <p>The coiche beneath the use of Helvetica Neue has been dictated by many factors. Even thogh it was created only in 1983, Helvetica Neue is a reworking of the well known Helvetica font created in 1957. The changes with respect to the latter are the more structurally unified set of heights and widths, the improved legibility and the heavier punctuation marks.</p>
            <p>The scalability of Helvetica Neue gave us the possibility to improve easy reading, given by the font weight and size, and to produce clear contrasts, making the difference between texts width different dimension clearly recognizable.</p>
            <p>The color palette we used is based on the <a href="https://fabianburghardt.de/swisscolors/">Swiss Style color picker</a>.</p>

            <h3>Other references</h3>
            <p>Finally it is worth to mention that the home page animation is based on the <a href="https://www.pinterest.it/pin/22306960624083649/">Tonhalle Quartett poster by Müller-Brockmann</a>, already <a href="https://codepen.io/jonyablonski/pen/rxjePV">animated by Jon Yablonski</a> and readapted by us for the purposes of our website, changing proportions and animations' directions in order to hint at the vertical and horizontal flow of documents. On the other hand, the Pizzagate issue's page presentation has been inpired by the <a href="https://go.distance.ncsu.edu/gd203/?p=52972">Giselle poster by Armin Hofmann</a>.</p>



            <h2>2030</br>The future</h2>
            <p>Spoiler: our time-machine widget is not so powerful to project us to the future in order to bring back some reality-based inspiration (we are sorry for that).</p>
            <p>Our first choice has been the one of completely re-structure the web-site so to accomodate as much content as possible in a single-scrolling page. This provides the user with a non-infinite but al least longer scroll experience without a great dispersion of content.</p>
            <p>For obvious lacks of technological diffusion and availability, we were not able to construct a complete sensorial experience surrounding the user from different points of view. therefore, our main priority remained the one of imagine and present what the (near) future could look like from a typographic and layout-related perspective, with a margin of citationism towards common fanta-scientific beliefs and cultural references.</p>
            <p>The main animation running on top of the website pages if a futuristic eye (a metaphorical look to the future) <a href="https://codepen.io/miocene/pen/rNOVWor">animated by Julia Miocene</a>, which is in turn based on an <a href="image by Gleb Kuznetsov">image by Gleb Kuznetsov</a></p>
            
            <h3>Layout</h3>
            <p>We tried to make the website as minimal as possible so to enhance the possibility of the user to focus on only one thing at the time. We made great use of negative spaces that inthis case are filled with the inverted background gradient of the above cited animation, which is used as color-background for the whole website.</p>
            <p>The text is placed slightly on the left side of te webpage to let accomodate the eye of the user where normally the act of reading and writing in the western word starts, on the left indeed. The overall aim of ths typographic style is the one of making the user confortable and letting someone read without employing too much energies even in the eye placement of the screen.</p>

            <h3>Fonts and colors</h3>
            <p>In this case we opted for two fonts. In particular, Orbitron has been choosen for the titles for its geometrical shapes and its declared aim of being an alternative to common sci-fi based and futuristic typefaces. Moreover, Exo has been chosen for longer texts for its legibility and its purpose of <q cite="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Exo/about?query=exo">convey a technological/futuristic feeling while keeping an elegant design</q>.</p>
            <p>For what concerns colors, we decided to stick with the colors the animation came with because of the sense of peace they transmit. Still with the purpose of letting the user relax in front of the screen, we opted for avoiding shoking colors or too much contrasts. Therefore, we choose for the texts a dark lue and a violet with some transparency, preferring to convey the feeling of fluctuating over the surface of a distant planet made of milk and blueberries.</p>
