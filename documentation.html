            <h2>Idea and website's features</h2>
            <p>The project has been deveoped for the final exam of the “Information Modelling and Web Technologies” couse of the master's degree in Digital Humaities and Digital Knowledge of the University of Bologna.</p>
            <p>the magazine's topic is a personal choice of the project's authors. The selected texts has been chosen among authoritative articles aiming at analyzing conspiracies from differnet points of view and the souces can be found in the <a href="./disclaimer.html">disclaimer</a>. in particular, the issue where the texts are contained focuses on the Pizzagate conspiracy theory and, therefore, containes only articles and book-chapters dealing with this topic. This choice has been made so to provide the users with the possibility of comparing documents with references to similar entities.</p>
            <p>The entities we decided to highlight are the ones that made more sense to focus on given the topic, named people, places, organizations, events and concepts. Moreover, also general keywords without a specific refrence to the entity type can be added and highlighted.</p>
            <p>The website presents the possibility to change between different historically-inspired typographic styles and, in the issue section, the one of annotating and highlight keywords and entities. Furthermore, it is possible to choose between the single text and the comparison view to analyze the documents in the preferred way. In the comparison mode, metadata and entities-related fetures can be accessed by means of a modal, which can be activated by a button on the right side that appears only in two cases: when the user is in the comparison mode and when the screen is not enough wide to display the single-text-modal in a suitable way.</p>

            <h2>1500</br>To latest incunabula and beyond!</h2>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>books printed during the earliest period of typography—i.e., from the invention of the art of typographic printing in Europe in the 1450s to the end of the 15th century (i.e., January 1501).</p>
                </blockquote>
                <cite>From<a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/incunabula">Encyclopedia Britannica</a></cite>
            <p>We decided to refer to this year as a year of "transition" from the incunabula-period to the principles that governed western printing to the late 18th century. in particular, we took inspiration from the typographic type of incunabula, which are the ones <q cite="http://guity-novin.blogspot.com/2012/04/modern-newspaper-magazine-layouts.html#Three">made with movable type on a printing press in the style of Johann Gutenberg</q> and, starting from here, we decided to adapt to the current medium the canonical structures governing the layut of books printed during the 16th century.</p>
            
            <p>It would have been difficult to grasp each detail of about an entire century of print and typographic history, also because <q cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incunable#Types">the spread of printing to cities both in the North and in Italy ensured that there was great variety in the texts and the styles which appeared.</q> Therefore, we decided to stick with the basic principles and the main features of these editions.</p>

            <h3>Layout</h3>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Incunabula's layout designs still resembled the medieval compositions using classical ornamentation, initials and bordering but with a greater use of white space. The incunabula layout designers made a grater use of columns for aesthetical effects. </p>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
                The composition is commonly positioned slightly toward the left side of the page, with a wider right-hand margin that aesthetically anchors the negative space of the page rendering the visual impact exquisite and pleasing.
            </blockquote>

            In Italy, in particular, types were modeled on humanistic typefaces, which in digital formats are still in use today. 



            Fibonacci sequence to arrive at relative margin sizes (inner margin 3 units; top and outer margins 5 units; bottom margin 8 units). The gutter is treated as the central axis, and there is one column of text. The outer and bottom margins are larger than the inner and top. These optical adjustments ensure that the text doesn’t appear to be falling off the bottom of the page. 

            This idealized and mathematically organized layout with symmetrical forms of typography in a series of grid systems, harnessing the startling classical world view of balanced design and typography.

            Taking over the same book design as the manuscripts, border decoration was done on the first leaf of a book or chapter

            In the classical layout type was generally set in one justified column per page, placed symmetrically on the spread with larger outer margins than inner, and a larger margin at the foot than at the head. From the start, printers understood the importance of the relative relationships of various elements of layout. The mathematical proportions of various segments and margins were determined by geometry, and designers adhered to the aesthetic rules that governed the harmonious relationships of points, lines, surfaces, and solids to one another.

            Golden Rectangle, which provides the design its elegant mathematical balance.  -> non possiamo averlo in quanto la nostra pagina si estende in verticale e basta quindi l'abbiamo adattato attrverso i margini

            A distinctive feature of incunabula is that the typefaces used are rich in variety.  --> ne usiamo solo due in realtà uno per l'iniziale e l'altro per il testo


            Gothic and Roman were two major types used for incunabula, while italic type came into use in the 16th century.

            the printers of incunabula used various typefaces depending on the manuscript based on which they made books. In those days, there were no craftsmen specialized in type casting, so printers had to create the punches themselves or purchase them, or purchased only the matrices to cast the type themselves. -> il nostro font fa vedere "imperfezioni"

            Roman type, meanwhile, accounts for 20% of all the types used in incunabula. This type arose from humanism in the Italian Renaissance, which aimed at the revival of ancient Roman cultural styles. For manuscripts by humanists, the script "antiqua," which Poggio Bracciolini (1380-1459), Niccolò Niccoli (d.1436) and Coluccio Salutati (1331-1406) had created in the early 15th century by further developing the "fere-humanistica" script used by Petrarch, was used chiefly in Florence. In the middle of the 15th century, a script imitating the uppercase-letters used for inscriptions on ancient Roman monuments came into use, which eventually developed into the Roman type.



            https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inknut+Antiqua/about
            »Inknut Antiqua« is an Antiqua typeface for literature and long-form text. Approaching the idea of web-publishing as a modern day private press, it is designed to evoke Venetian incunabula and humanist manuscripts, but with the quirks and idiosyncrasies of the kinds of typefaces you find in this artisanal tradition.
