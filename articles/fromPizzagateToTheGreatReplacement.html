    <h3 class="article-section">Abstract</h3>
    <p class="article-p">
        This chapter discusses the circulation of conspiracy theories evolving from concoctions of Internet subcultures to global topics of public conversation and political mobilization. The examples provided are those of the <span class="mention concept" >Pizzagate</span> and <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> conspiracy theories, which embody the anti-establishment ethos, the paranoid disposition and the ironic attitude of <span class="mention concept" >far-right</span> on-line communities. The chapter analyzes the spreading of a set of myths, symbols and codes created by the <span class="mention keyword" >4chan</span> and <span class="mention keyword" >8chan</span> users within a global network of White ethnonationalists. The <span class="mention concept" >far-right</span> anti-immigration conspiracy theory ‘<span class="mention concept" >The Great Replacement</span>’ is discussed to explore the interlocking themes of White identity politics, trolling and the ‘weaponization’ of Internet entertainment.
    </p>


    <h3 class="article-section">Introduction</h3>
    <p class="article-p">
        This chapter discusses the global circulation of conspiracy theories, with a special emphasis on fictional political narratives originating from Internet message boards and discussion forums. Specifically, the focus of the analysis is on conspiracy theories alleging plots by global liberal elites or progressive movements, popular among <span class="mention concept" >White supremacists</span> and <span class="mention concept" >far-right</span> circles. The chapter attempts to trace a profile of the most popular conspiracy theories currently dominating the discourse among users of fringe spaces of the Internet, especially <span class="mention keyword" >4chan</span>, <span class="mention keyword" >8chan</span> and <span class="mention keyword" >Reddit</span>. Such on-line conversations, often cloaked in ironic language, emerge from a subcultural milieu that has been conducive to acts of on-line harassment as well as of violence and terrorism. The 2016 <span class="mention concept" >Pizzagate conspiracy theory</span> is presented as the blueprint for fictional political narratives growing out of the contributions of multiple authors in various world regions. The <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> conspiracy theory, an offshoot of <span class="mention concept" >Pizzagate</span>, is also presented as an open-ended collective narrative based on paranoid attitudes toward political institutions and establishments, typical of the current era of Internet-driven populism and radical politics. The chapter also discusses how the conspiracy theories under examination functioned as outlets for the collective elaboration of unaddressed political scandals.
    </p>
    <p class="article-p">
        In the second part of the chapter, <span class="mention concept" >the ‘Great Replacement’</span> conspiracy theory is discussed as a narrative of victimization of people of White ethnicity, serving as an ideological framework for a growing wave of violent actions by White nationalists worldwide. The on-line communications of White terrorists are brought under examination as they crystallize many aesthetic, cultural and ideological elements common to other on-line subcultures and movements mobilizing around claims of marginalization and dispossession. <span class="mention concept" >Memes</span> and other elements of Internet popular culture are discussed as ideologically charged resources of on-line culture wars. Reference to <span class="mention concept" >post-truth</span> theory is offered throughout the chapter to place the discussion of on-line conspiracy theories within the broader conceptual framework presented in the book’s introduction.

    <h3 class="article-section">Pizzagate: The Blueprint for Global On-Line Conspiracy Theories</h3>
    <p class="article-p">
        One of the most absurd and creative of the many fictional political narratives circulating in <span class="mention event" >the 2016 US presidential election</span> cycle—characterized by large amounts of <span class="mention concept" >misinformation</span> and <span class="mention concept" >disinformation</span>, especially via social media Footnote 1—was the conspiracy theory Footnote 2 that went by the name of ‘<span class="mention concept" >Pizzagate</span>.’ The theory alleged that Comet Ping Pong, a Washington pizzeria, was the operational base of a high-profile ring of pedophiles and Satanists, which included top political figures of the <span class="mention organization" >Democratic Party</span> such as the then presidential candidate <span class="mention person" >Hillary Clinton</span> and her former campaign manager <span class="mention person" >John Podesta</span>. Even before a self-styled vigilante named <span class="mention person" >Edgar Welch</span> decided to approach this odd story armed with weapons,Footnote 3 an investigation by the <span class="mention organization" >Washington Police Department</span> had already dismissed <span class="mention concept" >Pizzagate</span> as a baseless conspiracy theory, mostly circulating on-line via discussion forums, anonymous imageboards, right-wing alternative news sources and social media accounts (Marwick and Lewis 2017). Articles from The New York TimesFootnote 4 and SnopesFootnote 5 reported that there was no evidence in support of the allegations against Comet Ping Pong. These revelations had, however, not prevented many to continue to believe in the existence of a sordid scandal. On the contrary, the debunking, as it is often the case in context of <span class="mention concept" >post-truth</span> concoctions such as conspiracy theories, had the effect of further stoking the suspicions among the <span class="mention concept" >Pizzagate</span> proponents. For the entire month of November 2016, after the story had been repeatedly dismissed by mainstream media, rumors and speculations around Comet Ping Pong continued to circulate on social media, generating over a million <span class="mention keyword" >Twitter</span> messages with the <span class="mention concept" >hashtag #Pizzagate</span>.Footnote 6
    </p>
    <p class="article-p">
        According to <span class="mention person" >Craig Silverman</span> of Buzzfeed, one of the first journalists to investigate the association between social media and <span class="mention concept" >disinformation</span>, <span class="mention concept" >Pizzagate</span> “shows how <span class="mention person" >Trump</span> supporters, members of <span class="mention keyword" >4chan</span> and <span class="mention keyword" >Reddit</span>, and right-wing blogs in <span class="mention place" >the United States</span> and in other countries combined to create and spread viral <span class="mention concept" >misinformation</span> during the election season.”Footnote 7 It also demonstrates how thin are the boundaries between virtual and real repercussions of <span class="mention concept" >disinformation</span>, and how “real-world harassment and violence can emerge as a direct result of media manipulation and <span class="mention concept" >misinformation</span> online” (Marwick and Lewis 2017, 56). The conspiracy theory is thus a case in point of the multilayered, collaborative and troublesome <span class="mention concept" >post-truth</span> dynamics at work during the 2016 US elections, as a plurality of actors motivated by different but overlapping reasons was involved in its creation, circulation and real-life escalation.
    </p>
    <p class="article-p">
        The most active sources of allegations behind <span class="mention concept" >Pizzagate</span> were the imageboard <span class="mention keyword" >4chan</span> and the discussion forum <span class="mention keyword" >Reddit</span>,Footnote 8 popular especially among a variety of Internet subcultures, as well as with people affiliated with the American ethnonationalist <span class="mention concept" >far-right</span>, the so-called <span class="mention concept" >alt-right</span>.Footnote 9 Social media were also instrumental in igniting the conspiracy theory: the first allegation that <span class="mention person" >Hillary Clinton</span> was involved in a pedophile ring was made by a <span class="mention keyword" >Twitter</span> account associated with <span class="mention concept" >White supremacists</span> on October 30, 2016. In a cross-pollination between <span class="mention concept" >far-right</span> and anti-Clinton social media users, the tweet referenced a <span class="mention keyword" >Facebook</span> message by an American woman claiming to have revelations from the <span class="mention organization" >New York Police Department</span> about material on the laptop of <span class="mention person" >Anthony Weiner</span>—former US Congressman involved in a ‘sexting’ scandal with a minor—which suggested that <span class="mention person" >Hillary Clinton</span> was part of a child trafficking ring in association with convicted sex offender <span class="mention person" >Jeffrey Epstein</span>.Footnote 10 Revelations about the emails found on Weiner laptop that were relevant to the <span class="mention person" >Hillary Clinton</span> email controversy—possibly the most prominent theme of <span class="mention event" >the 2016 campaign</span>—started to circulate on <span class="mention keyword" >4chan</span> and <span class="mention keyword" >Reddit</span>, stoking fantastic conjectures among their users. Some of these were picked up by both <span class="mention concept" >junk-news</span> web sites and ‘clickbait fabricators’ (Benkler et al. 2018), often styled to appear as legitimate news sources, which were important drivers of <span class="mention concept" >disinformation</span> in 2016.
    </p>
    <p class="article-p">
        At the same time, many <span class="mention keyword" >4chan</span> and <span class="mention keyword" >Reddit</span> users were sifting through the thousands of emails that been hacked from the mail servers of <span class="mention person" >John Podesta</span> by means of a phishing scam. The hacking, done by two groups of Russian hackers called <span class="mention organization" >Fancy Bear</span> and <span class="mention organization" >Cozy Bear</span>,Footnote 11 had resulted in a leaking by the counter-information site <span class="mention organization" >WikiLeaks</span> of a trove of personal email communication of <span class="mention person" >Podesta</span>. When <span class="mention organization" >WikiLeaks</span> started making the email available on-line, users of <span class="mention keyword" >4chan</span>, in particular those active in the /pol/ discussion group, a virtual meeting place for <span class="mention person" >Trump</span> supporters, searched through them for any information that could be used to damage <span class="mention person" >Hillary Clinton</span>. Some <span class="mention keyword" >Reddit</span> users, active on the discussion group r/The Donald, also popular among <span class="mention person" >Trump</span> supporters, suggested that the emails contained coded messages alluding to pedophiliac practices. The term ‘pizza,’ for example, frequently recurring in the email exchanges of <span class="mention person" >Podesta</span>, was alleged to be used by the pedophile ring to suggest ‘underage girls.’Footnote 12 This is when the various rumors started to be collected in a common narrative that was labeled <span class="mention concept" >Pizzagate</span>. After such narrative involving Comet Ping Pong appeared on <span class="mention keyword" >4chan</span> and <span class="mention keyword" >Reddit</span>, <span class="mention keyword" >Facebook</span> right-wing partisan pages and professional conspiracy theorists like the British <span class="mention person" >David Icke</span> and the American <span class="mention person" >Alex Jones</span> gave wider amplification to the initial rumors and creative elaborations. While a lot of grassroots input went into popularizing <span class="mention concept" >Pizzagate</span>, the role of <span class="mention person" >Alex Jones</span> and of other social media conspirations was crucial. <span class="mention concept" >Pizzagate</span> thus shows “how online virality—far from a measure of sincere popularity—is a force that can be manipulated and sustained by just a few influential social media accounts” (Singer and Brooking 2018, 404). This observation is also valid for the role of social media influencers amplifying <span class="mention concept" >Russian propaganda</span> in the context of the <span class="mention event" >Syrian Civil War</span>, as discussed in the next chapter.
    </p>
    <p class="article-p">
        The <span class="mention concept" ><span class="mention concept" >Pizzagate</span> conspiracy theory</span> took shape as a collective mythology by means of a collaborative storytelling via social media, imageboards, discussion forums and other alternative on-line information outlets, which was amplified by <span class="mention concept" >post-truth</span> influencers and entrepreneurs. A fantastic narrative that nonetheless had all the characteristics to excite and mobilize the most radical fringes among <span class="mention person" >Donald Trump</span> supporters and even some people close to the <span class="mention person" >Trump</span> administration (Neiwert 2017). What makes this conspiracy theory particularly interesting is of course its timing, right before <span class="mention event" >the 2016 US presidential election</span>s, as its exposure and resonance were magnified by an electoral cycle characterized by a highly polarized and aggressive public discourse, which has proved fertile ground for the circulation of <span class="mention concept" >misinformation</span> and <span class="mention concept" >disinformation</span> (Benkler et al. 2018).
    </p>
    <p class="article-p">
        <span class="mention concept" >Pizzagate</span> had also clear connections with another problematic aspect of <span class="mention event" >the 2016 election cycle</span>, namely the <span class="mention event" >Russian cyberattacks</span> and media manipulation strategies to influence the American democratic process, as discussed in the previous chapter. The hacking of the <span class="mention person" >Podesta</span> emails made possible by the actions of Russian hackers, allegedly under direct supervision of <span class="mention organization" >the Kremlin</span>,Footnote 13 was in fact the initial spark of the <span class="mention concept" ><span class="mention concept" >Pizzagate</span> conspiracy theory</span>. Also, means of computational propaganda (Woolley and Howard 2018) linked to Russian manipulation and influence tactics played a role on the amplification of <span class="mention concept" >Pizzagate</span>, as “a combination of <span class="mention concept" >bots</span> and <span class="mention concept">bot</span>-like accounts were used to make the topic trend, suggest grass-roots activity, and provide enough legitimacy that real people were inspired to join in” (Marwick and Lewis 2017, 38).
    </p>
    <p class="article-p">
        The sudden popularization of <span class="mention concept" >Pizzagate</span> is an indication of the unique dynamics that were at work during <span class="mention event" >the 2016 American elections</span>. All the actors involved in the ‘<span class="mention concept" >epistemic crisis</span>’ (Benkler et al. 2018) plaguing that election cycle operated jointly: foreign actors, associated with antagonistic governments,Footnote 14 engaged in operations of media manipulation in the form of leaking of sensitive information, which resulted in the circulation of <span class="mention concept" >disinformation</span> via on-line networked communities of <span class="mention concept" >trolls</span>, <span class="mention concept" >far-right</span> activists, social media, alternative news outlets, fake news factories and political influencers. Such vast seeding of <span class="mention concept" >disinformation</span>, amplified by social media algorithms favoring sensational content, found a receptive ground in the ideological milieu of <span class="mention concept" >far-right</span> or populist movements, as in the case of the American ethnonationalist <span class="mention concept" >far-right</span>, which welcomed any type of information or narratives that could be used to mobilize their base against establishment politicians, and to challenge the discourse of the so-called mainstream liberal media.Footnote 15
    </p>
    <p class="article-p">
        Given the global nature of <span class="mention concept" >Pizzagate</span>, which is a case in point for the complexity of the current flows of on-line <span class="mention concept" >disinformation</span>, it should not be surprising to find out that the conspiracy theory resonated well beyond the American borders. The so-called <span class="mention concept" >junk news</span> and clickbait entrepreneurs active out of Veles,Footnote 16 Macedonia, a major producer of <span class="mention concept" >disinformation</span> on <span class="mention event" >the 2016 election cycle</span>, feasted on <span class="mention concept" >Pizzagate</span> and participated to the further elaboration and circulation on the original allegations about Comet Ping Pong, adding new fictional elements to its core narrative.
    </p>
    <p class="article-p">
        <span class="mention concept" >Pizzagate</span> was also for a while also a sensitive political topic in <span class="mention place" >Turkey</span>, where in late 2016 a group of supporters of Turkish President Erdogan started to spread the same rumors on Comet Ping Pong that had been circulating in <span class="mention place" >the United States</span>. Social media accounts and <span class="mention concept" >trolls</span> affiliated with the Erdogan AK party (Bulut and Yörük 2017) were at the forefront of the <span class="mention concept" >disinformation</span> effort, supported by the main national media, which popularized the alleged scandal to the broader Turkish public.Footnote 17 The pro-Erdogan Turkish commentators expediently took the <span class="mention concept" >Pizzagate</span> scandal as an indication of the moral corruption of Western leaders, above all <span class="mention person" >Hillary Clinton</span>, thus tapping on the similar rhetoric against liberal and globalist leaders used by populist and nationalist politicians such as <span class="mention person" >Donald Trump</span> in United States or Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson in the UK. Writing on the subject on The Daily Dot, Turkish journalist and researcher Efrem Sozeri argued that <span class="mention concept" >Pizzagate</span> was a case of a truly <span class="mention concept" >far-right</span> global conspiracy theory, appealing to both White nationalists in <span class="mention place" >the United States</span> and right-wing Islamist nationalists in <span class="mention place" >Turkey</span>. In a whirlwind of <span class="mention concept" >misinformation</span> and <span class="mention concept" >disinformation</span> on a global scale, a <span class="mention keyword" >Twitter</span> account named @pizza_gate, which for a while was one of the main sources of updates on the alleged scandal, turned out to be equally popular among conspiracy theorists in <span class="mention place" >the United States</span> as in <span class="mention place" >Turkey</span>.
    </p>
    <p class="article-p">
        The Turkish interest for <span class="mention concept" >Pizzagate</span>, and its reverberations on Western media, illustrates very well how <span class="mention concept" >post-truth</span> as a global condition currently occurs within complex networks of reiterations, modifications and amplifications of false information extending beyond national borders. Such fictional narratives can become political expedients in contexts that are completely different from those in which they were born. At the same time, the global feedback on the <span class="mention concept" >Pizzagate</span> reinforced the belief among American conspiracy theorists and right-wing voters, and the involvement of Turkish media was as unexpected as it was timely for the supporters of <span class="mention person" >Donald Trump</span>.
    </p>
    <p class="article-p">
        One of the most significant aspects of the <span class="mention concept" >Pizzagate</span> incident was the already mentioned inability of the verification process by official authorities and mainstream media to change the belief of the conspiracy theory proponents. Fact-checking efforts ended up backfiring and stoking even further the suspicions among believers. This fits Harsin’s theory that in the <span class="mention concept" >post-truth</span> condition, debunking and verification are rarely effective since there is no trusted public venue in which authority can definitively debunk <span class="mention concept" >disinformation</span> and thus suture the conflicting segments of the public opinion (Harsin 2015).
    </p>

    <h3 class="article-section">From <span class="mention person" >Epstein</span> to <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span>: The Emancipatory and Playful Side of Conspiracy Theories</h3>
    <p class="article-p">
        There is, however, another aspect about the genesis and circulation of <span class="mention concept" >Pizzagate</span> that is worth taking into consideration. Uscinski (2017) offers an original reading of conspiracy theories that isn’t necessarily concerned with their epistemic value. Instead, he considers conspiracy theories as being eminently ‘notions about power’ that serve as resources and tools of dissent by the weak and disenfranchised segments of society to offset against inequality and injustice. Seen through this emancipatory perspective, conspiracy theories offer an outlet of imaginary and imaginative articulation for popular fantasies and aspirations about power, and about challenges to the existing power structure.
    </p>
    <p class="article-p">
        In this sense, one could read conspiracy theories as attempts to address the hidden and more opaque aspects of power. Such narrative forms of mobilization against power, while often relying on scarce evidence, on a surplus of fictional elaboration, and only a small kernel of truth, nonetheless play an important role in freeing people’s aspirations of political change. As argued by Kalpokas, “menacing narratives that involve (…) plots by malicious others can have a strong ‘feel good’ factor” and are “efficient in arousing and mobilizing audiences” (Kalpokas 2018, 19). <span class="mention concept" >Pizzagate</span> served this function as it presented the elementary narrative structure of the classic conspiracy theory format, based on “archetypal malevolent elites carrying out their dirty deeds behind everybody’s back with impunity” (Kalpokas 2018, 19).
    </p>
    <p class="article-p">
        Conspiracy theories can thus function as fictions charged with affective and aspirational values, providing the publics with possibility of agency in the construction of emancipatory expressions. Fictional narratives with a paranoid streak such as conspiracy theories operate as forms of co-operation between grassroots aspirational efforts and top-down strategies of public opinion manipulation. While enabled and exploited by foreign agents and also by political influencers such as <span class="mention person" >Alex Jones</span>, <span class="mention concept" >Pizzagate</span> also served as an outlet for regular people to express their grievances against the perceived impunity of political and financial elites. This latter function of the conspiracy theory is best encapsulated by the recent revelations surrounding the arrest and subsequent death of disgraced financier and convicted sex offender <span class="mention person" >Jeffrey Epstein</span>, whose name was associated with the Clintons in the original rumors about the child trafficking ring allegedly operating in <span class="mention place">Washington</span>.
    </p>
    <p class="article-p">
        As already discussed, the debunking of <span class="mention concept" >Pizzagate</span>, while ineffective in diffusing the anxieties around the fictitious scandal, it nonetheless widely demonstrated that the allegations on Comet Ping Pong were baseless. Even a radical conspiracy theorist such as <span class="mention person" >Alex Jones</span> retracted his initial support for <span class="mention concept" >Pizzagate</span> after the incident at the <span class="mention place">Washington</span> pizzeria.Footnote 18 However, months after the violent exploit of <span class="mention person" >Edgar Welch</span>, some supporters of <span class="mention concept" >Pizzagate</span> were still convinced that the theory contained some truth, and “expressed frustration that the mainstream news was not taking their concerns seriously and covered the story only dismissively” (Marwick and Lewis 2017), claiming that it deserved a more thorough investigation. This insistence could be explained by acknowledging that there was, in fact, a small element of truth in <span class="mention concept" >Pizzagate</span> that did have an actual reference to real events.
    </p>
    <p class="article-p">
        The collective storytelling that gave rise to <span class="mention concept" >Pizzagate</span> was initially started by a rumor that in fact addressed an element of the judicial case involving <span class="mention person" >Jeffrey Epstein</span>, specifically the reference to the so-called Lolita Express plane that belonged to the millionaire, which he used to bus his elite circle of friends and underage girls to his private islands in the <span class="mention place" >Caribbean</span>.Footnote 19 The <span class="mention person" >Epstein</span> case, dating back to 2005, had for many years lingered in the background of the broader political discourse as an example of how powerful people could use their connections to defy justice. In 2008, <span class="mention person" >Jeffrey Epstein</span> was charged by the <span class="mention organization" >Palm Beach Police Department</span> for soliciting prostitution with minors. Since 2005, he had also been under investigation by the <span class="mention organization" >FBI</span> on the allegation that he had been running a vast trafficking and cult-like sex enslavement ring involving dozens of underage girls across multiple locations. However, <span class="mention person" >Epstein</span> was only sentenced for his lesser crimes, and the <span class="mention organization" >FBI</span> investigation on the more serious crimes was blocked when <span class="mention person" >Epstein</span> entered into discussions for a plea deal with then Miami US Attorney <span class="mention person" >Alexander Acosta</span>.Footnote 20 The deal signed by <span class="mention person" >Epstein</span> was kept secret, and the sentence he received is considered to be the most lenient ever received by a serious sex offender.Footnote 21
    </p>
    <p class="article-p">
        In July 2019, the <span class="mention organization" >FBI</span> arrested <span class="mention person" >Epstein</span> with new charges of sex trafficking with minors and conspiracy to engage in sex trafficking minors, and the following month, he was found dead in his cell in a Manhattan correctional facility. The circumstances surrounding <span class="mention person" >Epstein</span> death became immediately fertile ground for further conspiracy theories, which echoed some of the elements of the original <span class="mention concept" >Pizzagate</span> narrative, suggesting the existence of a powerful cabal of political and financial elites who feared his possible confessions after his arrest.Footnote 22 In the aftermath of his death, <span class="mention person" >Donald Trump</span> retweeted a message by a right-wing personality alleging that the Clintons were involved in the murder of <span class="mention person" >Epstein</span>. In the now global amplification process of conspiracy theories, Russian information channels such as RT and Sputnik dedicated coverage to <span class="mention event"><span class="mention person" >Epstein</span>’s suspicious death in jail</span>. Two rival hashtags, #clintonbodycountand #trumpbodycount, went viral at the time, pushing opposing theories about the involvement with his death in prison of either the Clintons or <span class="mention person" >Trump</span>, who both had been associated with <span class="mention person" >Epstein</span> in the past.Footnote 23
    </p>
    <p class="article-p">
        As one commentator observed, “the circumstances of <span class="mention person" >Epstein</span>’s life and career are essentially tailor-made to produce conspiracy theories (…) because so many of the most important questions about how <span class="mention person" >Epstein</span> gained and retained his power have gone unanswered.”Footnote 24 Some speculations suggested that <span class="mention person" >Epstein</span>’s main business was “collecting footage or other evidence of his powerful friends having sex with underage girls so he could force the men to invest money with him.”Footnote 25 Other rumors pointed to his involvement with the US government. During his testimony to the <span class="mention person" >Trump</span> transition team, <span class="mention person">Acosta</span> said that at the time of the plea deal he was told that “<span class="mention person" >Epstein</span> ‘belonged to intelligence’ and to leave it alone.”Footnote 26 Both allegations fit of course well with the basic conspiracy theory frame of powerful groups scheming secretly, with the assistance of State apparatuses, to advance illicit agendas. The fact that they have been lingering as unaddressed or even suppressed issues for many years reinforces the collective suspicions about the political establishment that allowed <span class="mention person" >Epstein</span> to defy justice.
    </p>
    <p class="article-p">
        <span class="mention concept" >Pizzagate</span> thus operated as a form of collective and spontaneous elaboration, based on a kernel of truth, of the largely unaddressed <span class="mention person" >Epstein</span> scandal, which one <span class="mention person" >Epstein</span> victims called a “conspiracy that a lot of powerful people wanted to go away.”Footnote 27 The core narrative element of <span class="mention concept" >Pizzagate</span>—the existence of a child trafficking ring among powerful elites—represented a sort of repressed or hidden truth that was channeled through a storytelling in the form of a conspiracy theory. In this sense, one is tempted to agree with Uscinski bold claim that “conspiracy theories are necessary to the healthy functioning of a society because they help balance against concentrations of power” (Uscisnki 2017, 2). This reading of the phenomenon echoes the interpretation of <span class="mention concept" >post-truth</span> communications as ‘aspirational emancipatory counternarratives,’ which can offer an immediately gratifying, albeit elusive, forms of political action for the ‘marginalized and the alienated,’ as argued by Kalpokas.
    </p>
    <p class="article-p">
        With some many unanswered questions surrounding the life and death of <span class="mention person" >Epstein</span>, it shouldn’t surprise that the core of suspicion at the heart of <span class="mention concept" >Pizzagate</span> survived even after the fading of the conspiracy theory. <span class="mention concept" >Pizzagate</span> in a sense didn’t die out, but it simply morphed into a different, even more complex conspiracy theory going by the name of <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span>. <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> emerged in October 2017, again by means of its circulation via <span class="mention keyword" >4chan</span>, sharing the same narrative core as <span class="mention concept" >Pizzagate</span>: the existence of a secret global child sex ring run by liberal political and financial elites. Unlike <span class="mention concept" >Pizzagate</span>, <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> posited also the involvement of so-called deep state entities.Footnote 28 But just as with <span class="mention concept" >Pizzagate</span>, <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> storytelling hints to the core elements of the <span class="mention person" >Epstein</span> scandal that remain undisclosed and unaddressed, especially the role of well-connected politicians, businessman and celebrities involved in the child trafficking ring. With a further fictional twist on the basic <span class="mention concept" >Pizzagate</span> storytelling, <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> proponents also claim that the Mueller investigation on <span class="mention person" >Trump</span>’s alleged collusion with <span class="mention place">Russia</span> was in fact just a cover-up for what was instead a secret collaboration between the two to bring down the alleged global child sex ring.Footnote 29

        The name <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> is a reference to the highest security clearance available in the Department of Energy in the US government, allowing access to information about nuclear weapons. A <span class="mention keyword" >4Chan</span> user called <span class="mention person" >Q Clearance Patriot</span>, or simply Q, claiming to have top security clearance, started to post with relative frequency cryptic messages—‘bread crumbs’ or QDrops in the parlance of its followers—often written as riddles, aimed at sparking people curiosity on a series of political issues. The posts then became material for speculation and investigation by the broader community of <span class="mention keyword" >4chan</span>, who collectively elaborated on Q’s posts. The conspiracy theory thus evolved as a collection of various political concoctions, also going under the title of ‘<span class="mention concept" >The Storm</span>’ or ‘<span class="mention concept" >The Great Awakening</span>,’ revolving around a common theme, that is the role of <span class="mention person" >Donald Trump</span> as savior of regular American citizens against the scheming of political elites and State apparatuses. As a result, <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span>s have become closely associated with the broader community of <span class="mention person" >Trump</span> supporters, and <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> t-shirts and signs frequently appear at <span class="mention person" >Trump</span> events.

    <p class="article-p">
        Another element of similarity between the <span class="mention concept" >Pizzagate</span> and <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> is their nature of collaborative and playful storytelling emerging out of the subcultural milieu of imageboards. The various plot twists of the <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> narrative, ranging from the implausible to the ludicrous, often just ended up adding ironic layers to the basic set of beliefs, legitimate as it might be for some proponents of the theory. Irony and provocation are integral to the conversations occurring on imageboards, and fictional elaborations are often exaggerated in order to trigger reactions in the media or among the broader public opinion (Nagle 2017; Phillips 2015). <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> pushed the collaborative and playful angle even further by making the participation in the conspiracy theory as a kind of role-playing game. As commented by Alyssa Rosenberg in the Washington Post, <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> added an element of so-called gamification, or the application of game principles, to the standard process of elaboration and circulation of conspiracy theories: “The best way to think of <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> may be not as a conspiracy theory, but as an unusually absorbing alternate-reality game with extremely low barriers to entry. The ‘Q’ poster’s cryptic missives give believers a task to complete on a semiregular basis. Even more so than conventional video games (…) <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> is open-ended.”Footnote 30 The game-like participation in <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> is one of its most appealing aspects, and it reflects a common trait of on-line conspiracy theory and on-line harassment campaigns, which entice new members with entertaining experience such as scoring points, gaining status within the community or increasing its visibility. This is of course also a reflection of the subcultural milieu of <span class="mention keyword" >4chan</span>, infused with reference to videogame culture (Phillips 2015).
    </p>
    <p class="article-p">
        As with <span class="mention concept" >Pizzagate</span>, also <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> migrated from on-line to real life, thanks to its popularization via an extensive media coverage, support by celebrities and its game-like nature. However, just like with its precursor, the transition to real life didn’t occur without violent repercussions. In May 2019, after a series of violent crimes associated with <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> believers, including the murder of a mafia boss, the <span class="mention organization" >FBI</span> identified <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> as a domestic terrorist threat, making it the first fringe conspiracy theory to be labeled as such. An <span class="mention organization" >FBI</span> memo on the subject said that “conspiracy theories very likely will emerge, spread, and evolve in the modern information marketplace, occasionally driving both groups and individual extremists to carry out criminal or violent acts.”Footnote 31
    </p>
    <p class="article-p">
        While one can acknowledge, like Uscinski and Kalpokas do, that conspiracy theories can perform a politically and emotionally liberating function for their supporters—as it was revealed by the <span class="mention person" >Epstein</span> case—there remains a fundamentally problematic aspect about the construction of simplistic and paranoid political narratives intent at obfuscating evidence-based investigations and official accounts. As commented by a researcher on <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span>, such a complex and multilayered conspiracy theory can function and spread since society now operates as a ‘marketplace of realities,’Footnote 32 a notion that echoes Harsin’s concept of truth-markets (Harsin 2015) as the founding elements of the <span class="mention concept" >post-truth</span> condition. Through fantastical collective storytelling and game-like experiences on various contentious political issues, on-line communities have given people the ability to break down a consensual, evidence-based reality and to transform it by bending it to their desires, aspirations or fears, even the most radical or delirious.

    <h3 class="article-section">‘Remove Kebab’: Ethnonationalism Between Memes and Terrorism</h3>
    <p class="article-p">
        In the <span class="mention keyword" >Facebook</span> Live feed streamed by <span class="mention person" >Brenton Tarrant</span>, the Australian <span class="mention concept" >far-right</span> terrorist and White supremacist who killed 51 people in <span class="mention event">two separate attacks in <span class="mention place" >Christchurch</span>, New Zealand, on March 15, 2019</span>, one particular song, among others, could be heard playing in the attacker’s car moments before he began shooting inside the <span class="mention place" >Al Noor mosque</span>. The song is called ‘<span class="mention concept" >Remove Kebab</span>,’ also known as ‘<span class="mention concept" >Serbia strong</span>,’ an Islamophobic and Serbian nationalist song of the turbo-folk genre. The lyrics celebrate <span class="mention person" >Radovan Karadžić</span>, the Bosnian Serb leader in <span class="mention event" >the 1990s Yugoslav wars</span> who was found guilty of <span class="mention event" >genocide against Bosnian Muslims</span>. Since the mid-2000s, the song has gained Internet popularity among a loose community of videogame players and White nationalists.Footnote 33 For <span class="mention concept" >White supremacists</span> and ethnonationalists active on <span class="mention keyword" >4chan</span> and <span class="mention keyword" >8chan</span>, the phrase <span class="mention concept" >Remove Kebab</span> has become a synonym for their Islamophobic inclinations, the most radical of which is the ethnic cleansing of Muslims from Western countries.Footnote 34 In the 74-page long document—a manifesto of some sorts entitled ‘<span class="mention concept" >The Great Replacement</span>’—that <span class="mention person">Tarrant</span> circulated via <span class="mention keyword" >Twitter</span> and on <span class="mention keyword" >8chan</span> before the attack, he referred to himself as someone who has been “working part time as a Kebab removalist,” an ironic presentation of his own anti-Muslim stance as well as an obvious homage to the Internet <span class="mention concept" >memes</span> spawned around the ‘<span class="mention concept" >Remove Kebab</span>’ song.

        The title of <span class="mention person">Tarrant</span>’s manifesto, where he laid out the background and the motivations behind his murderous actions, cloaking them in a humorous language full of subcultural references, hints to <span class="mention concept" >the Great Replacement</span> conspiracy theory, a recurring theme in the rhetoric of <span class="mention concept" >far-right</span> nationalist movements. While circulating among European right-wing circles for over a century, the conspiracy theory was recently re-popularized by French author <span class="mention person">Renaud Camus</span>, who claims that technocratic elites in France and in Europe are responsible for a plan aimed at replacing Europeans of White ethnicity with immigrants of different ethnicity, particularly from Muslim countries.
    </p>
    <p class="article-p">
        In his 2011 work Le Grand Remplacement, <span class="mention person"> Camus</span> blames industrialization and capitalism for encouraging mass immigration, unregulated demographic growth among immigrants and low birth rate among White Westerners. These factors are considered to be parts of the engineered substitution of the White European ethnicity and cultural tradition by Muslim immigrants, actively pursued by a loosely defined transnational elite that <span class="mention person"> Camus</span> calls the ‘<span class="mention concept">Davos-cracy</span>’Footnote 35—from the Davos summit—consisting of liberal politicians and business executives for whom workers are replaceable elements without any connection to their homeland or cultural heritage. “We are experiencing an invasion on a level never seen before in history. Millions of people pouring across our borders, legally. Invited by the state and corporate entities to replace the White people” write <span class="mention person">Tarrant</span> in his manifesto.Footnote 36
    </p>
    <p class="article-p">
        <span class="mention concept" >The Great Replacement</span> theory parallels that of the ‘<span class="mention concept">White Genocide</span>,’ another trope of contemporary White nationalist and supremacist discourse and propaganda (Neiwert 2017). It refers to the idea that the genetic and cultural heritage of White people in <span class="mention place" >the United States</span> is being jeopardized or even annihilated by means of miscegenation and forced assimilation with non-White immigrants. The conspiracy theory was made popular by American neo-Nazi <span class="mention person">David Lane</span> in his 1995 <span class="mention concept">White Genocide</span> Manifesto, where he placed explicit blame on Jewish elites for allegedly masterminding the plot. While <span class="mention concept" >the Great Replacement</span> is at its core an Islamophobic belief, <span class="mention person">Lane</span>’s ideology is anti-Semitic. The parallel themes of <span class="mention concept" >the Great Replacement</span> and of <span class="mention concept">White Genocide</span> have both antecedents in right-wing politics during the decolonization era in Europe and in post-Civil War America,Footnote 37 and in recent years, they have become central tenets of a global discourse of <span class="mention concept" >White supremacists</span> and <span class="mention concept" >far-right</span> terrorists responsible for violent acts in multiple countries, as well of the rhetoric of right-wing political parties and populist movements both in EuropeFootnote 38 and in <span class="mention place" >the United States</span> (Davey and Ebner 2019). <span class="mention person" >Brenton Tarrant</span> made reference to both conspiracy theories in his manifesto, and in the slogans written on his weapons, he referred to both <span class="mention person">Lane</span>’s and <span class="mention person"> Camus</span>’ ideas.Footnote 39
    </p>
    <p class="article-p">
        While explicitly referencing several concepts from the conspiracy theories above, <span class="mention person">Tarrant</span>’s Manifesto was, however, a more stratified text than a simple espousal of right-wing anxieties about immigration. According to <span class="mention concept" >far-right</span> radicalization expert <span class="mention person">Robert Evans</span>,Footnote 40 the sprawling text was written with a series of layered references and intentions, in typical troll style (Nagle 2017), in order to provoke a reaction in the media and to inspire potential copycats by signaling his familiarity to the <span class="mention keyword" >4chan</span> and <span class="mention keyword" >8chan</span> subcultures. <span class="mention person">Tarrant</span> manifesto and his communications via social media were thus addressed to two types of intended audience. At one level, they were meant to be read and absorbed by the media, together with other elements of his ‘media-friendly’ violent actions, such as the <span class="mention keyword" >Facebook</span> Live streaming, which added to his violent rampage an immersive quality typical of first-person shooter videogames. The first part of the manifesto is structured as a mock interview, presumably to provide media with soundbites to be widely distributed. However, unlike the densely theoretical terrorists’ manifesto of the past, in his document <span class="mention person">Tarrant</span> inserted several jokes, with the goal of stoking controversy and sparking media curiosity, but also of disguising his messages under a layer of irony that would cast doubt on its reliability and the seriousness of his political action.
    </p>
    <p class="article-p">
        <span class="mention person">Tarrant</span>’s crafting of this part of the manifesto mirrors the on-line practice of ‘<span class="mention concept">shitposting</span>,’ typical also of <span class="mention concept" >alt-right</span> communications (Marwick and Lewis 2017; Singer and Brooking 2018), which consists of spreading “content, most of it ironic, low-quality trolling, for the purpose of provoking an emotional reaction in less Internet-savvy viewers” and to “to derail productive discussion and distract readers.”Footnote 41 Among the references to the imageboard subculture, <span class="mention person">Tarrant</span> included the well-known textual <span class="mention concept">meme</span> ‘Navy Seal copypasta’Footnote 42 in the mock self-interview. Such <span class="mention concept">meme</span> was targeted at imageboards members, but it was also meant to trick journalists, so that they would mistakenly believe the attacker to be a former Navy Seal. In the manifesto, Brenton also credits American right-wing personality <span class="mention person">Candace Owens</span> with beginning his radicalization. While <span class="mention person">Owens</span> has championed anti-immigration positions, this statement was certainly meant to troll the media, since it was followed by <span class="mention person">Tarrant</span> claiming that the videogame Spyro the Dragon 3 taught him ethnonationalism. This could be interpreted as responding to an established practice among anons,Footnote 43 or members of <span class="mention keyword" >4chan</span> and <span class="mention keyword" >8chan</span>, to troll or provoke the media for the sake of the lulz (Phillips 2015).
    </p>
    <p class="article-p">
        At a deeper level, however, the ironic parts of the manifesto were also meant to be received, both as a source of inspiration and as a set of codes signaling subcultural affiliation, by a global network of <span class="mention concept" >trolls</span>, <span class="mention concept" >alt-right</span> and <span class="mention concept" >far-right</span> sympathizers. According to Evans, some of the content of the manifesto acted as bait “to draw the attention of his real intended audience.”Footnote 44 Ambiguity and irony are a common rhetorical strategy in the discourse of <span class="mention concept" >far-right</span> activists, as proudly claimed by <span class="mention concept" >alt-right</span> poster boy and provocateur <span class="mention person">Milo Yiannopoulos</span> (Cosentino 2017). Before leaving the car to enter the mosque and commit multiple murders, <span class="mention person">Tarrant</span> could be heard saying “Remember lads, subscribe to PewDiePie,” which is another reference to a <span class="mention keyword" >4chan</span> and <span class="mention keyword" >8chan</span> jargon. His ironic yet disruptive strategy is rendered obvious in this particular passage from the manifesto, where he calls on people who share his view to stir conflict by means of ambiguous tactics: “Place posters near public parks calling for sharia law, then in the next week place posters over such posters calling for the expulsion of all immigrants, repeat in every area of public life until the crisis arises.” This <span class="mention concept" >post-truth</span> approach to subversive political action echoes the manipulative tactics originally conceptualized by Surkov in <span class="mention place">Russia</span> and employed by the <span class="mention organization">IRA</span> during the 2016 US elections, as discussed in Chapter 2.
    </p>
    <p class="article-p">
        <span class="mention person">Tarrant</span> thus appears to have crafted the perfect terrorist political manifesto of the <span class="mention concept" >post-truth</span> era, skillfully tiptoeing a fine line between a radical fascist ideology and ironic jokes, between real threats and fictional elements, just like a Joker-type figure that entertains his fans and the media while committing hideous crimes. In the aftermath of the attack, the mainstream media channels, as well the main social media platforms, made several efforts not to publicize the attacker’s <span class="mention keyword" >Facebook</span> video nor his manifesto, in order to limit the possibilities of copycats. <span class="mention person">Tarrant</span>, however, had made sure that his intended audience had received it in advance. On March 15, 2019, just before the events in <span class="mention place" >Christchurch</span>, an anonymous message—most likely submitted by <span class="mention person">Tarrant</span> himself—was posted to <span class="mention keyword" >8chan</span>’s /pol/board announcing an attack, which was to be livestreamed on <span class="mention person">Tarrant</span>’s <span class="mention keyword" >Facebook</span> page, as well as links to several copies of the manifesto uploaded to different web sites.
    </p>
    <p class="article-p">
        In the post, <span class="mention person">Tarrant</span> declared his intention to move from ‘<span class="mention concept">shitposting</span>’ to ‘<span class="mention concept">effort posting</span>,’ which in the anon parlance means resorting to actual actions in real life. The post also encouraged other members of the imageboard in spreading <span class="mention person">Tarrant</span>’s message by means of “<span class="mention concept" >memes</span> and <span class="mention concept">shitposting</span>,” that is in the same semi-serious style of communications used by <span class="mention person">Tarrant</span> and by the broader imageboard subculture. In the manifesto, <span class="mention person">Tarrant</span> also encourages to “Create <span class="mention concept" >memes</span>, post <span class="mention concept" >memes</span>, and spread <span class="mention concept" >memes</span>” claiming that “<span class="mention concept" >Memes</span> have done more for the ethno-nationalist movement than any manifesto.”Footnote 45 This statement explains why <span class="mention person">Tarrant</span>’s manifesto was full of memetic references, and reveals its belief that the most effective forms of inspiration and mobilization for on-line activists are <span class="mention concept" >memes</span> and other elements of Internet popular culture. The validity of <span class="mention person">Tarrant</span> belief in memetic warfare (Singer and Brooking 2018) is corroborated by the imageboards’ reactions to the <span class="mention place" >Christchurch</span> attack. According to Evans, anons generally responded with enthusiasm to the actions and antics of <span class="mention person">Tarrant</span>, celebrating them on <span class="mention keyword" >8chan</span> as the achievement by one of them: “The shooter’s frequent use of in-jokes and <span class="mention concept" >memes</span> played extremely well with this crowd. (…) The shooter seems to have achieved his goal of providing the anons of <span class="mention keyword" >8chan</span> with lulz, and with inspiration” (Evans 2019).
    </p>
    <p class="article-p">
        According to his own declaration in the manifesto, <span class="mention person">Tarrant</span> became radicalized as a <span class="mention concept" >far-right</span> terrorist two years prior to his <span class="mention event">attack in <span class="mention place" >Christchurch</span></span>. During a number of travels to various European countries in 2016 and 2017, in the aftermath of multiple <span class="mention event"><span class="mention organization">ISIS</span>-inspired attacks to European cities</span>, he became particularly concerned with the threat of <span class="mention concept">Islamic fundamentalism</span> in the West. He also had become fascinated with the Balkan tradition of anti-Muslim sentiment, and with the history of <span class="mention event">the Balkan wars</span> of resistance against the Ottoman Empire. Many of the weapons used by <span class="mention person">Tarrant</span> during the attacked had been marked with references to famous historical episodes of such history.Footnote 46
    </p>
    <p class="article-p">
        By his own admission in the manifesto, the <span class="mention place" >Christchurch</span> attacker drew also inspiration from Norwegian <span class="mention concept" >far-right</span> terrorist <span class="mention person">Anders Breivik</span>Footnote 47—who in 2011 killed 77 people in two separate <span class="mention event">attacks against government offices and against the <span class="mention organization">Labour Party Youth Association</span></span>—adding that he had received approval for his actions from people affiliated with Breivik. The <span class="mention event">2015 Charleston attack against African-American churchgoers committed by <span class="mention person">Dylan Roof</span></span> was also cited as a source of inspiration for <span class="mention person">Tarrant</span>. More recently, the ideological and communication elements of the <span class="mention place" >Christchurch</span> attack worked as a template for other attacks, including <span class="mention event">the 2019 <span class="mention place">El Paso</span> shooting</span>. The <span class="mention place">El Paso</span> mass killer, <span class="mention person">Patrick Wood Crusius</span>, had also posted a manifesto on <span class="mention keyword" >8chan</span>, in which he echoed many of the same grievances and beliefs expressed by <span class="mention person">Tarrant</span>, including reference to <span class="mention concept" >the Great Replacement</span> conspiracy theory. The most recent sequence of violent actions by White ethnonationalists seems to present a pattern in the functioning of their radical politics, with imageboards and other fringe on-line venues serving as platform of radicalization, ideological support and inspiration that travel across borders, and <span class="mention concept" >memes</span> and conspiracy theories serving as a common language and discourse (Davey and Ebner 2019). As conspiracy theories based on White identity politics increasingly circulate on-line, they go beyond being an American or European political narrative and become a “call to arms to protect what is seen as the white race on a transnational level.”Footnote 48
    </p>
    <p class="article-p">
        The radicalization of the attacker in <span class="mention place">El Paso</span> also happened in the <span class="mention keyword" >8chan</span>/pol board, and an element of ‘gamification’ has been observed in the communications around the <span class="mention place" >Christchurch</span>, as well as in the <span class="mention place">El Paso</span> and <span class="mention place">Pittsburgh</span> attacks.Footnote 49 Among <span class="mention concept" >far-right</span> activists and imageboards <span class="mention concept" >trolls</span>, a kind of contest aimed at surpassing the body count of previous attacks started to become popular. The game-like quality of on-line conspiracy theory such as <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> and <span class="mention concept" >the Great Replacement</span>, and their violent escalation in real life, seems to be a common thread in the subcultural milieu of imageboards, where ironic layers, playful attitudes and radical political intentions are often intermixed.
    </p>
    <p class="article-p">
        Many observers also noted a parallel between the rhetoric of populist leaders such as <span class="mention person" >Donald Trump</span>,Footnote 50 who started his presidential campaign in 2016 stoking fears around an alleged invasion of Mexican immigrants with criminal intentions to <span class="mention place" >the United States</span>, and the xenophobic discourse common to the perpetrators of violent attacks in the name of <span class="mention concept" >the Great Replacement</span> ideology. Several right-wing politicians and <span class="mention concept" >far-right</span> movements have piggybacked on the anti-immigration wave that has swept across the Europe since 2015 and 2016, in the aftermath of <span class="mention event">the massive exodus of Syrian refugees fleeing from <span class="mention organization">ISIS</span> and Russian aerial bombings</span>. The radical American ethnonationalists who have supported <span class="mention person" >Donald Trump</span>, led by self-styled ideologues such as <span class="mention person">Richard Spencer</span>, are increasingly aligned with the positions of xenophobic right-wing populism that has surged in many parts of Europe. As radical ideas and beliefs against immigration have gained more traction and media coverage, the defense of European or Western ethno-culture that appears in many of the manifestos of <span class="mention concept" >far-right</span> terrorists is becoming a mainstream political theme. The politically ambiguous concept of defending a common cultural heritage is then used as a justification for legitimizing ideas that are at their core dubiously close to racism and hate speech.
    </p>
    <p class="article-p">
        Such surge of ethnonationalist politics across multiple Western countries, as well as in <span class="mention place" >the United States</span>, appears to dovetail with the renewed Russian nationalism infused with religious and messianic references promoted by <span class="mention person">Putin</span> under the guidance of Volodin. <span class="mention person">Putin</span>’s ambitions for a Russian political and cultural hegemony over Europe, and more broadly over the Western world, is now openly predicated on the defense of Christian heritage and values (Engström 2014). Of course, such strategy also results from Russia’s ambitions to regain prominence and to challenge American global dominance. The allegations of connections between the American <span class="mention concept" >far-right</span> movements and conservative Russian ideologues and politicians,Footnote 51 the already discussed accusations of collusion of the <span class="mention person" >Trump</span> campaign with Russian officials and the evidence of <span class="mention event">interference of <span class="mention organization">the Russian government</span> in the 2016 elections</span> unearthed by the investigation of the <span class="mention organization">US Department of Justice</span> seem all to fall within a broader strategy by <span class="mention organization">the Russian government</span> to extend its sphere of geopolitical influence by relying on its appeal to a Christian conservative ideology challenging the moral and political relativism of liberal multiculturalism.
    </p>
    <p class="article-p">
        <span class="mention person">Tarrant</span>’s critique of the Western liberal democratic order appears to be genuinely rooted in his radical worldview and belief system, which fits with the Russian critique of Western liberal democracy. Identifying the culprit for the current state of social, political and environmental disarray, in his manifesto <span class="mention person">Tarrant</span> speaks of a “mainstream, ‘multicultural,’ egalitarian, individualistic insanity” caused by liberal democracy and market capitalism. The suggested solution is to accelerate the crisis by means of “further polarizing Western society,” another point that mirrors the Russian interference strategies to undermine the American democratic process discussed in the previous chapter. When arguing for the necessity of “radical, violent change,” <span class="mention person">Tarrant</span> mentions the philosophy of ‘accelerationism,’ originally proposed by British scholar Nick Land as a political approach to human and social progress based on speeding up economic and technological change and embracing the most destabilizing tendencies of capitalism.Footnote 52
    </p>
    <p class="article-p">
        A darker, more subversive strand of the original <span class="mention person">Land</span> idea has found warm reception among <span class="mention concept" >far-right</span> movements across the world. This version of accelerationism aims at exacerbating existing social and political conflicts in order to undermine the foundations and the fabric of democracy, with the goal of establishing White ethno-states devoid of immigrants. This type of right-wing accelerationism, also known as ‘darkcel,’ is the political philosophy echoed by <span class="mention person">Tarrant</span> in his manifesto, where he argues: “Stability and comfort are the enemies of revolutionary change. Therefore, we must destabilize and discomfort society wherever possible.(…)” through actions such as “voting for political candidates that radically change or challenge entrenched systems, radicalizing public discourse by both supporting, attacking, vilifying, and exaggerating all societal conflicts and attacking or even assassinating weak or less radical leaders/influencers on either side of social conflicts.”Footnote 53 <span class="mention person">Tarrant</span> actions should thus be read through the ideological prism of right-wing accelerationism, which advocates violent actions as means to speed up the decline of Western liberal democracy, alongside other transformative events such as the Brexit and the <span class="mention person" >Trump</span> presidency. As observed by Andy Beckett on The Guardian, “The disruptive US election campaign and manic presidency of <span class="mention person" >Donald Trump</span>, and his ultra-capitalist, anti-government policies, have been seen by an increasing number of observers (…) as the first mainstream manifestation of an accelerationist politics.”Footnote 54
    </p>

        Even <span class="mention person">Tarrant</span>’s choice of weapons, including the use of the AR15 military-style assault rifle, was done with an accelerationist mind-set. His goal was to further elevate the status of such deadly and contested weapon—used in many recent mass shootings, including by <span class="mention person" >Edgar Welch</span> in his <span class="mention event">foray at Comet Ping Pong</span>—as a polarizing wedge within the American debate on gun control. <span class="mention organization">IRA</span> <span class="mention concept" >trolls</span> also pushed divisive content on the issue of gun rights in <span class="mention place" >the United States</span> with the same intention of <span class="mention person">Tarrant</span> that is “to create conflict between the two ideologies within <span class="mention place" >the United States</span> on the ownership of firearms in order to further the social, cultural, political and racial divide.”Footnote 55 Coherently with his admiration for <span class="mention event">the Balkan wars</span> against the Ottoman, and against the Bosnian Muslim minority during the Yugoslav wars, <span class="mention person">Tarrant</span> literally refers the “balkanization of the US” as one of the goals that he aims to achieve through his actions.

    In his manifesto, <span class="mention person">Tarrant</span> hints to a familiar aspiration in the rhetoric of contemporary <span class="mention concept" >far-right</span> ethnonationalism, particularly in <span class="mention place" >the United States</span>, which is the fragmentation and the dissolution of the country as a unified federal entity. Such grandiose objective would cause two related consequences, desired by ethnonationalists, which are the decline in the global hegemony of the multicultural United States and the creation of a plurality of ethnically pure smaller nations, along the model pursued by Serbian nationalists during <span class="mention event">the 1900s Yugoslav wars</span>. Such outcome “will not only result in the racial separation of the people within <span class="mention place" >the United States</span> ensuring the future of the white race on the North American continent, but also ensuring the death of the ‘melting pot’.”Footnote 56 The collapse of the American multiculturalism and the invocation of a race war is another recurring theme of the <span class="mention concept" >far-right</span> discourse, and it is a direct reference to the Turner’s Diary, a dystopian novel by White supremacist author <span class="mention person">William Luther Pierce</span>, a seminal text in the tradition of the American <span class="mention concept" >far-right</span>. The ideas of a race war and the collapse of <span class="mention place" >the United States</span> as necessary preconditions for the emergence of a White ethno-state as a post-America are ‘apocalyptic fantasies’Footnote 57 frequently espoused also by <span class="mention person">Richard Spencer</span>, the principal ideologue of the American <span class="mention concept" >alt-right</span>.

    <h3 class="article-section">Conclusions</h3>
    <p class="article-p">
        The wave of <span class="mention concept" >far-right</span> politics that that has swept across <span class="mention place" >the United States</span> and Europe in recent years has brought several conspiracy theories from the fringes of on-line subcultures to the center of mainstream political conversations. Conspiracy theories are not anymore marginal, niche discourses relegated to an inferior epistemic status, but have gained legitimacy as alternative explanations for social and political problems. Their popularity owes also to the expedient endorsement by demagogic politicians such as <span class="mention person" >Donald Trump</span>. After his own <span class="mention event">election to the US presidency</span>, <span class="mention person" >Trump</span> has continued spreading conspiracy theories, including the allegation that <span class="mention person">Obama</span> had wiretapped <span class="mention person" >Trump</span>’s office inside the Trump Tower, or that three million people had voted illegally in 2016. It would not be far-fetched to argue that <span class="mention person" >Trump</span> has elevated conspiracy theories as founding elements of his political communication strategy. This signals that the conspiratorial ethos, out of which fictional narratives such as <span class="mention concept" >Pizzagate</span> and <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> have emerged, currently permeates political conversations across from <span class="mention place" >the United States</span> to Europe, with important global ramifications.

    <p class="article-p">
        A worldview based on conspiracy theories or beliefs “implies a universe governed by design” (Barkun 2013), where all-powerful cabals scheme against the welfare of the majority, or against a weak or dispossessed minority. As belief systems, conspiracy theories mirror the same Manichean divisions that undergird the populist rhetoric, pitting a powerful elite against an innocent and subjugated population. Conspiracy theories, as suggested by Uscinski, encapsulate challenges to power by marginal or disposed groups. More broadly, they signal the existence of a power crisis. It is the crisis of political power and of its representative institutions, from the media to cultural-scientific institutions, that allows for marginal, unorthodox political narratives to breach into the public conversation. The crisis of the epistemic paradigms that have underpinned the functioning of the Western modernity package, consisting on the technocratic management of society and on the twin pillars of liberal democracy and free-market capitalism, has caused the collapse of a regime of truth and consequently allowed the rapid growth of regimes of <span class="mention concept" >post-truth</span>, relying on conspiracy theories. People who have stopped trusting institutions adopt conspiracy theories as epistemic gateways to decipher and expose the inner logics of political power.
    </p>
    <p class="article-p">
        As Western democracies seem increasingly unable to offer effective solutions to world problems that become more urgent and graver—from environmental threats to widening economic inequality, from massive migration flows to terrorism—conspiracy theories allow their believers to have their fears assuaged by a simple explanation that identifies a culpable subject yet avoids questioning the dynamics of power at their core. They offer a simulation of political action and critique that offers gratification, escapism, entertainment and a sense of political identity, without really demanding profound inquiry and sustained struggle to effectively address political and social problems.
    </p>
    <p class="article-p">
        Most of the conspiracy theories surveyed in this chapter share the common theme of a globalist elite of liberal politicians that operates secretively to undermine the standing of Western countries and of people of White ethnicity. Conspiracy theories on this theme could be seen as a kind of popular narrative that disenfranchised White Westerners tell themselves to process their cultural and political crisis and exorcise their fear of an irreversible decline. Conspiracy theories thus offer simple recipes for explaining complex realities and give their proponents the consolation of seeing themselves as elect carriers of secret and repressed knowledge. For proponents of conspiracy theories, the marginal or fringe status of their knowledge reinforces the belief of being representatives of a marginalized worldview that rests in direct opposition with an epistemic and political status quo. In some cases, as we have seen with the <span class="mention person" >Epstein</span> affair, conspiracy theories do act as channels of suppressed truths, while, however, falling short of really engaging with the structural causes of scandals and injustices.
    </p>
    <p class="article-p">
        Barkun (2013) has observed that <span class="mention concept" >far-right</span> ideologies often present a convergence between apocalyptic beliefs and conspiracy theories. <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> and Great Replacement supporters share a paranoid streak that borders with the apocalyptic, envisioning a grand plot aimed at the annihilation of the White race or at the exploitation of innocent victims on a global scale. The apocalyptic and paranoid components of the on-line conspiracy theories draw on a vast milieu of sources of inspiration to identify its multiple culprits, from global financiers like George Soros to the LGBTQ community, from immigrants to feminists. Continuously reinventing themselves, as we saw from the evolution of <span class="mention concept" >Pizzagate</span> into <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span>, conspiracy theories transform and adapt by relying tactically on disparate elements from political, cultural and quasi-scientific sources. Barkun calls this type of flexible, constantly changing conspiratorial attitude ‘improvisational millennialism,’ a type of do-it-yourself, game-like apocalyptic belief system that has conquered on-line communities like <span class="mention keyword" >4chan</span> and has motivated people like <span class="mention person">Tarrant</span> to resort to deadly terrorist actions, all while spreading <span class="mention concept" >memes</span> and making jokes.

            On a Sunday in early December 2016, less than a month after the election of Donald Trump as the 45th President of the United States, a man named Edgar Welch entered Comet Ping Pong brandishing an AR-15 assault rifle. He then asked all the clients to evacuate the place and started searching the premises looking for a basement connected to secret underground tunnels. The police arrived shortly after Welch had fired a few shots on the floor, with no injuries or casualties. By his own admission, he wanted to ‘self-investigate’ Comet Ping Pong, to see if the on-line rumors about the so-called Pizzagate conspiracy theory were true. He had read a lot about Pizzagate, including accounts from notorious conspiracy-theorist Alex Jones, and had come to Washington with the intention of freeing the children who he thought were kept enslaved in the basement of the pizzeria.
