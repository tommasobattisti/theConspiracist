    <h3 class="article-section">Abstract</h3>
    <p class="article-p">
        The <span class="mention concept" >QAnon Conspiracy</span> theory, which emerged in 2017, has quickly risen to prominence in the <span class="mention place" >United States</span>. 
        A survey of cases of individuals who have allegedly or apparently been radicalized to criminal acts with a nexus to violence
        by <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span>, including one case that saw a guilty plea on a terrorism charge, makes clear that <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> represents a public security 
        threat with the potential in the future to become a more impactful domestic terror threat. This is true especially given that 
        conspiracy theories have a track record of propelling terrorist violence elsewhere in the West as well as <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span>’s more recent 
        influence on mainstream political discourse.
    </p>

    <h3 class="article-section">What is the QAnon Conspiracy?</h3>
    <p class="article-p">
        The <span class="mention concept" >QAnon Conspiracy</span>5 emerged on Saturday, October 28, 2017, on <span class="mention keyword" >4chan</span>’sa /pol/ (politically incorrect page) 
        in a <span class="mention keyword" >thread</span>' called “Calm Before the Storm,” when an anonymous user signing off as ’<span class="mention person" >Q</span>’ stated that “<span class="mention person" >Hillary Clinton</span> 
        will be arrested between 7:45 AM – 8:30 AM EST on Monday – the morning on Oct 30, 2017.”6 <span class="mention person" >Q</span>’s nom de plume is in reference 
        to ”<span class="mention person" >Q</span>” clearance, a clearance level in the <span class="mention place" >United States</span> Department of Energy.
    </p>
    
    <p class="article-p">
        However, <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> finds its origins a year prior in the <span class="mention concept" >Pizzagate</span> conspiracy theory,7 which alleges 
        coded words and satanic symbolism purportedly apparent in <span class="mention person" >John Podesta</span>'’s emails, hacked during his tenure 
        as chair of <span class="mention person" >Hillary Clinton</span>’s <span class="mention event" >2016 U.S. presidential campaign</span>', point to a secret child sex trafficking ring 
        at a pizza restaurant in <span class="mention place" >Washington, D.C.</span>', called <span class="mention place" >Comet Ping Pong</span>. <span class="mention concept" >Pizzagate</span> came to a head in December 2016 
        when <span class="mention person" >Edgar M. Welch</span> (whose case is discussed in detail below) traveled from <span class="mention place" >North Carolina</span> “to the popular <span class="mention place" >DC</span> 
        pizzeria <span class="mention place" >Comet Ping Pong</span> with a handgun and an assault rifle to ‘self-investigate’ the validity of the <span class="mention keyword" >4chan</span> 
        conspiracy.”8 <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span>, beginning in 2017, thus originated out of the <span class="mention concept" >Pizzagate</span> conspiracy theory, retaining the 
        central belief that a <span class="mention organization" >cabal of powerful elites</span>' control the world, using their power to covertly abuse children.
    </p>

    <p class="article-p">
        <span class="mention person" >Q</span>’s claim on <span class="mention keyword" >4chan</span> to have special government access and that he/she is part of a wider “<span class="mention concept" >anon genre</span>” of government 
        officials with top secret information is not entirely novel. Before <span class="mention person" >Q</span>, several <span class="mention keyword" >4chan</span> posters asserted they had special 
        government access, including <span class="mention person" >FBIAnon</span>9 and <span class="mention person" >HLIAnon</span>10 in 2016, and <span class="mention person" >CIAAnon</span>11 and <span class="mention person" >WHInsiderAnon</span>12 in 2017. <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> devotees, 
        many of whom may be familiar with this “<span class="mention concept" >anon genre</span>”, thus are familiar with <span class="mention person" >Q</span>’s apparent need for anonymity and presumably 
        take it as a sign of credibility.
    </p>

    <p class="article-p">
        In July 2020, nearly three years following <span class="mention person" >Q</span>'s emergence, there remains no consensus on who the original<span class="mention person" >Q</span>was and who 
        manages the account today. However, there is a fair amount of evidence that demonstrates how <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> grew to prominence 
        from the narrow confines of <span class="mention keyword" >4chan</span> and <span class="mention keyword" >8chan</span>'.b According to a 2018 <span class="mention organization" >NBC</span>' News investigative report, the original<span class="mention person" >Q</span>post 
        “would have gone mostly unnoticed if not for three people – <span class="mention person" >Tracy Diaz</span>', a YouTube vlogger, and <span class="mention keyword" >4chan</span> 
        moderators Pamphlet Anon, identified as <span class="mention person" >Coleman Rogers</span>', and <span class="mention person" >BaruchtheScribe</span>', a South African man named <span class="mention person" >Paul Furber</span>'.”13 * <span class="mention organization" >NBC</span>' News reported 
        that <span class="mention person" >Rogers</span>' and <span class="mention person" >Furber</span>' reached out to <span class="mention person" >Diaz</span>', asking her to leverage her large YouTube following to promote the first ’<span class="mention person" >Q</span>’ posts.
        Without sharing the <span class="mention keyword" >4chan</span> <span class="mention keyword" >thread</span>' with <span class="mention person" >Diaz</span>'’ viewership, <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> may never have grown beyond its small following on the 
        image board site.
    </p>

    <p class="article-p">
        The authors have observed that QAnon supporters purport that their claims are empirical and do not ask that their 
        assertions be taken at face value. The <span class="mention organization" >QAnon community</span> is guided by the oft-repeated maxim, “<span class="mention concept" >do your own research</span>.”14 
        Imitating source citation and evidence presentation in academic scholarship, QAnon followers regularly engage in elaborate
        presentations of evidence to substantiate their claims. In this vein, they often self-identify as investigative journalists 
        or <span class="mention concept" >conspiracy researchers</span>'.15
    </p>

    <p class="article-p">
        <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> also represents a militant and anti-establishment ideology rooted in an apocalyptic desire to destroy the existing, 
        corrupt world to usher in a promised golden age.16 This position finds resonance with other <span class="mention concept" >far-right</span> extremist movements, 
        such as the various militant, <span class="mention organization" >anti-government</span>, <span class="mention organization" >white nationalist</span>, and <span class="mention organization" >neo-Nazi</span> extremist organizations across the <span class="mention place" >United States</span>. 
        In February 2020, <span class="mention organization" >Omega Kingdom Ministries</span>, in effect a <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> church, was established in the <span class="mention place" >United States</span> and other countries where 
        the <span class="mention concept" >QAnon Conspiracy</span> acts as an interpretive lens for the Bible and vice versa, and in which adherents are subjected to formalized 
        religious indoctrination into <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span>.c <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> followers share roots with conspiracy theories that have fed other <span class="mention concept" >anti-government</span> 
        movements, such as the <span class="mention organization" >90s militias</span> that feared the “<span class="mention concept" >New World Order</span>”, or the <span class="mention concept" >anti-government apocalypticism</span> and religious fervor 
        of the <span class="mention organization" >Branch Davidians</span>.17
    </p>

    <p class="article-p">
        Recent criminal cases with a nexus to violence involving <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> followers show how <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> has contributed to the radicalization 
        of ideologically motivated violent extremists (IMVE).18 According to the <span class="mention organization" >FBI</span>, <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> and other fringe conspiracy theories could 
        “very likely motivate some domestic extremists, wholly or in part, to commit criminal and sometimes violent activity” and noted 
        that “one key assumption driving these assessments is that certain conspiracy theory narratives tacitly support or legitimize 
        violent action.”19 Below, the authors provide a chronological summary of five criminal cases with a nexus to violence motivated, 
        in part at least, by <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> radicalization. They start with the aforementioned <span class="mention person" >Edgar Maddison Welch</span>, whose armed search of the 
        <span class="mention place" >Comet Ping Pong</span> pizzeria predated <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> but represents an ideological precursor to other <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span>-motivated actions.

    <p class="article-p">
        The authors now outline five criminal cases below with a nexus to violent crime linked to the <span class="mention concept" >QAnon conspiracy</span>.d
    </p>

    <h4 class="article-sub-section"><span class="mention person" >Edgar Maddison Welch</span></h4>
    <p class="article-p">
        <span class="mention person" >Edgar Maddison Welch</span>, a then 28-year-old from <span class="mention place" >Salisbury, North Carolina</span>, entered the <span class="mention place" >Comet Ping Pong</span> pizza restaurant 
        in <span class="mention place" >Washington, D.C.</span>', on December 4, 2016, with an AR-15 rifle and .38 revolver20 to potentially attempt to free children 
        he believed might be trapped in the building as part of a sex-trafficking ring.21 <span class="mention person" >Welch</span>, a volunteer firefighter with two 
        children,22 had a criminal record for incidents involving minor drug possession and driving under the influence of alcohol 
        in 2007 and 2013, respectively.e
    </p>

    <p class="article-p">
        <span class="mention person" >Welch</span> entered <span class="mention place" >Comet Ping Pong</span> with his AR-15 visible, causing employees and patrons to flee, to search for evidence of 
        child trafficking.23 Finding none, he shortly thereafter surrendered himself to the police on scene.24 <span class="mention person" >Welch</span> also admitted 
        that there was a loaded shotgun and ammunition in his car.25 An <span class="mention organization" >FBI</span> affidavit notes that, “the evidence from <span class="mention person" >Welch</span>’s cellphone 
        also suggest that <span class="mention person" >Welch</span> attempted to recruit at least two other people to join him,” though he was unsuccessful.26
    </p>
<!-- FIN QUI -->
    <p class="article-p">
        Evidence found on Welch’s cellphone indicates he watched several YouTube videos describing the ‘<span class="mention concept" >Pizzagate</span>’ conspiracy theory 
        in the days preceding his confrontation.27 Upon arrest, Welch corroborated that he had heard ‘news’ reports that there was 
        a child-sex trafficking ring in <span class="mention place" >Comet Ping Pong</span> restaurant.28
    </p>

    <p class="article-p">
        Welch was charged with federal and local weapons violations and pleaded guilty to a federal charge of interstate transportation 
        of a firearm and ammunition and a D.C. charge of assault with a dangerous weapon.29 He was sentenced to four years in prison in 
        June 2017, with three years of supervised release following his term in prison.30 Welch remains in prison and has expressed 
        regrets about his actions but maintains elements of the <span class="mention concept" >Pizzagate</span> theory are true.31
    </p>

    <h4 class="article-sub-section">Matthew Philip Wright</h4>
    <p class="article-p">
        On June 15, 2018, Matthew Philip Wright, a 30-year-old, unemployed Marine veteran from Henderson, Nevada,32 drove 
        an armored truck onto the Mike O’Callaghan-Pat Tillman Memorial Bridge near the Hoover Dam.33 Wright parked his vehicle 
        on the southbound lanes, blocking traffic,34 and stood outside the vehicle with a sign calling for the release of the 
        “OIG Report,”f which CNN reported was an “apparent reference to the US Justice Department’s internal watchdog report on 
        the department’s handling of the <span class="mention person" >Hillary Clinton</span> email probe.” The 568-page report had been released the previous day, 
        making Wright’s message unclear.35 <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> followers expected that the document would contain revelations about nefarious 
        government actors, suggesting Wright had engaged with <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> theories.36
    </p>

    <p class="article-p">
        After a 90-minute standoff with police, Wright drove away, refusing to stop for law enforcement until he drove over 
        tire strips and came to a stop.37 Upon arrest, law enforcement found in his vehicle two assault-style rifles and two 
        handguns, 900 rounds of ammunition, and a flashbang device.38
    </p>

    <p class="article-p"></p>
        Following his arrest, Wright wrote letters to senior government officials and politicians, as well as a letter to President Trump.39 
        In the letter to the president, Wright used the term the “Great Awakening”—<span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> language that refers to the reckoning Trump 
        is thought to bring to what they see as the “Cabal” that has infiltrated the U.S. government.40 In these letters, Wright used 
        the <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> phrase, “For Where We Go One, We Go All.”41
    </p>

    <p class="article-p">
        Wright was charged with obstruction of a highway, endangerment, unlawful flight from law enforcement, misconduct 
        involving a weapon, and terrorist acts.42 He later pleaded guilty to making a terrorist threat (designated as non dangerous), 
        an aggravated assault charge, and fleeing from law enforcement under a plea agreement with prosecutors, but the court recently 
        rejected the agreement for delivering too lenient of a prison term.43 g A future hearing date has been set to determine next steps, 
        and Wright appears to remain in Mohave County Jail.44
    </p>

    <h4 class="article-sub-section">Anthony Comellot</h4>
    <p class="article-p">
        While Wright’s actions received some media coverage, Anthony Comello’s alleged murder of mafia leader Frank (Francesco) Cali, 
        a senior member of the Gambino crime family, garnered massive national attention. On March 13, 2019, Comello, a 24-year-old 
        from Staten Island, New York, allegedly shot and killed Cali outside his family home.45 Comello, who lived with his parents in 
        Staten Island at the time, worked periodically in construction.46
    </p>

    <p class="article-p">
        The month before the incident, Comello entered a federal courthouse in Manhattan, requesting the arrest of Nancy Pelosi 
        and Mayor Bill de Blasio.47 The next day, February 22, 2019, Comello was spotted at the Gracie Mansion, the official mayoral 
        residence, asking officers to arrest high-profile Democrats, including Maxine Waters, Adam Schiff, and Nancy Pelosi.48 On 
        March 13, 2019, Comello allegedly drove to Cali’s family home, rang the doorbell, and engaged in a conversation with Cali. 
        Comello allegedly then pulled out a 9mm pistol and shot Cali several times.49 Comello was charged with one count of murder, 
        criminal possession of a weapon, and assault.50
    </p>

    <p class="article-p">
        In his first court appearance on March 18, 2019, Comello wrote a large ’<span class="mention person" >Q</span>’ in pen on his palm alongside several phrases 
        suggesting support for President Trump, such as “MAGA Forever.”51 In a submission to the court, Comello’s lawyer, Robert Gottlieb, 
        stated that Comello did not drive to Cali’s house intending to kill him, but to perform a citizen’s arrest as he believed Cali 
        was part of a purported deep state.52 Gottlieb claimed Comello shot Cali after he resisted the ‘arrest’53 and that Comello 
        believes he is “Trump’s chosen vigilante.”54
    </p>
    
    <p class="article-p">
        Following President Trump’s election in 2016, Comello reportedly became more interested in <span class="mention concept" >far-right</span> conspiracy theories, 
        and later became obsessed with <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span>.55 Gottlieb maintained this <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> obsession led to Comello’s February 2019 quest to 
        perform citizen’s arrests.56 Gottlieb submitted evidence to the court that Comello was posting about <span class="mention concept" >far-right</span> conspiracies 
        on his Instagram account, and engaging with <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> accounts.57 According to Gottlieb, Comello came across posts that alleged 
        the New York mafia was part of a purported deep state alongside the Democrats.58 Four days following his arrest, Comello 
        confessed to the NYPD that he believed the mafia had been infiltrated by the CIA and that the government was spying on him.59 
        On June 3, 2020, Comello was deemed mentally unfit to stand trial and was ordered to be transferred to an Office of Mental 
        Health facility for examination.60
    </p>
    
    <h4 class="article-sub-section">Eduardo Moreno</h4>
    <p class="article-p">
        Just over a year after Comello’s alleged murder of Cali, 44-year-old train engineer Eduardo Moreno, allegedly derailed a 
        train in San Pedro, California, on March 31, 2020, to draw attention to the nearby USNS Mercy naval ship and the government’s 
        response to COVID-19.61 The USNS Mercy was stationed in San Pedro to treat COVID-19 patients.62 Moreno allegedly derailed the 
        train by refraining from breaking near the end of the track, causing the train to smash through several fences before coming to 
        rest near the USNS Mercy.63 In post-arrest interviews with the <span class="mention organization" >FBI</span>, he claimed derailing the train was not preplanned.64
    </p>
        
    <p class="article-p">
        It is unclear whether Moreno was inspired specifically by <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> theories. Court documents note that in post-arrest interviews, 
        Moreno stated that “they are segregating us and it needs to be put in the open.”65 The court filing notes that, “Moreno is 
        suspicious of the U.S.N.S. Mercy and believes it had an alternative purpose related to COVID-19 or a government takeover.”66 
        It has not been determined that he was particularly motivated by <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span>-related theories. Further, posts by<span class="mention person" >Q</span>before the 
        derailing do not explicitly mention the USNS Mercy.
    </p>

    <p class="article-p">
        However, many of Moreno’s comments following his arrest seem related to <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span>. <span class="mention person" >Q</span>'s first post about COVID-19 was on March 23, 
        one week before Moreno allegedly derailed the train.<span class="mention person" >Q</span>insinuated in the post that China developed the virus to harm President 
        Trump’s presidency and ensure Joe Biden wins the next election.67 On March 28, 2020,<span class="mention person" >Q</span>claimed “[t]hey [the Cabal] want you 
        [the American people] divided” by religion, sex, political affiliation, and class so “you pose no threat to their control.”68 
        Moreno’s comments to the LAPP (Los Angeles Port Police) after his arrest that “they are segregating us and it needs to be put 
        in the open” perhaps were made in this light.69 Moreno also claimed “the whole world is watching,”70 quite similar in phrasing 
        to another<span class="mention person" >Q</span>post on March 28, 2020, which begins, “the entire world is watching.”71 Finally, according to an LAPP affidavit, 
        Moreno admitted to derailing the train to “wake people up,”72 similar to <span class="mention person" >Q</span>'s repeated references to the “Great Awakening”—a mass 
        realization about the truth of the world73—which<span class="mention person" >Q</span>also posted about on March 28, 2020.74 These connections made by the authors, 
        however, are speculative, and more information is needed to confirm if Moreno had any relationship with <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span>. On April 1, 2020, 
        the Department of Justice announced Moreno had been charged with one count of train wrecking.75 As far as the authors can 
        determine from their tracking of court proceedings, he has yet to enter a plea.
    </p>

    <h4 class="article-sub-section">Jessica Prim</h4>
    <p class="article-p">
        To better explicate the threat <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> poses to public security, the authors now describe, in greater detail, 
        the apparent radicalization to violence of Jessica Prim. Prim, a 37-year-old feature dancer from Peoria, Illinois, 
        was arrested in New York City on April 29, 2020, after allegedly driving onto a pier with a car full of knives.76 
        Prim was charged upon arrest with possession of marijuana and 18 counts of criminal possession of a weapon. She also 
        livestreamed this two-day trip from Illinois to New York City and in it threatened to kill Joe Biden (without making 
        it clear when or where) for his supposed involvement in a ‘deep state’ sex trafficking ring, in line with <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> narratives.77
    </p>

    <p class="article-p">
        Prim had allegedly attempted to get close to US Naval ship USNS Comfort, a hospital ship sent to New York City for 
        treating COVID-19 patients,78 as she drove up a service road on Pier 86.79 However, she had mistaken USS Intrepid, a 
        former aircraft carrier, for USNS Comfort.80 QA­non followers thought the USNS Comfort was being used to rescue children 
        from the “Cabal.” According to her social media posts and video livestreams as she headed to New York City, Prim alternated 
        between believing this and that the children may be being held hostage on the ship.81
    </p>

    <p class="article-p">
        What stands out with this case is the rapidity with which Prim apparently radicalized to violence. From her first 
        contact with <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> propaganda, apparently on April 9, 2020—based on her Facebook posts, which the authors reviewed 
        in detail—20 days passed until she made threats of offline violence while in transit to New York City.
    </p>

    <p class="article-p">
        Prim first started posting about <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> in a closed Facebook group named <span class="mention concept" >Pizzagate</span> Investigations Worldwide. On April 9, 2020, 
        she replied to a post in the group, and on April 14, she shared the link to the <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> “documentary” Out of Shadows to the page. 
        Prior to April 9, 2020, there is no evidence Prim was familiar with or interacting with <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> content. Her social media feeds 
        from 2016 onward do not provide any evidence that she engaged with <span class="mention concept" >Pizzagate</span> conspiracy content, or the <span class="mention place" >Comet Ping Pong</span> 
        altercation in December 2016. The authors’ review of Jessica Prim’s social media postings found that she did not post regularly 
        about domestic politics on her social media prior to April 2020.82

        How did an individual who only recently discovered <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> apparently radicalize to violence so fast? Her hours of livestreams, 
        which are a rich source of personal information, suggest some possible answers. Radicalization is an individual process, and 
        as such, some anecdotes Prim recounts in her videos indicate what may have made her vulnerable to radicalization to 
        <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span>-related violence.
    </p>

    <p class="article-p">
        Since 2012, Prim has regularly posted content related to missing children, child abuse, and arrests of child abusers. 
        This is very likely central to her susceptibility to <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> narratives that feature a global sex-trafficking ring. Her 
        social media content and livestreams reflect the significance of this narrative in her conversion to <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> ideology.83
    </p>

    <p class="article-p">
        It is unclear what caused Prim to spiral out of control in the twenty days preceding her arrest. One element, 
        however, emerges in a Facebook video she posted on April 28, 2020, at 12:35pm: her relationship with <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span>, she 
        stated in the video, began when one of her clients recommended she watch Fall of the Cabal, a <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> documentary 
        by Dutch conspiracy theorist Janet Ossebaard.84 In this livestream, Prim claims this video motivated her to research 
        <span class="mention concept" >Pizzagate</span>, and later, <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span>. Prim’s first Facebook post about <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> being on the <span class="mention concept" >Pizzagate</span> Investigations Worldwide 
        page is consistent with this claim.
    </p>

    <p class="article-p">
        Her sharing of the link to the <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> documentary Out of Shadows is consistent with this hypothesis, as the documentary 
        also focuses on <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> claims about a global child sex trafficking ring. Since she began radicalizing into the <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> ideology, 
        Prim has posted about a wide range of related conspiracy theories regarding sex trafficking rings and the supposed Deep State 
        government’s tyrannical attempts to control its population.85
    </p>

    <p class="article-p">
        According to the authors’ review of statements in her livestream and Facebook posts, Prim also apparently believes that 
        she is the “whore of Babylon” mentioned in the Book of Revelation, and is apparently convinced she has a role in bringing 
        about the ‘storm’ that<span class="mention person" >Q</span>promises.86 h Further, Prim claims she is the coronavirus (what this means is unclear) and that 
        President Trump speaks to her directly in press conferences and over social media.87 A document Prim apparently posted on 
        her Twitter account reveals she was diagnosed with a “brief psychotic disorder” following her arrest on April 29, 2020.88
    </p>

    <p class="article-p">
        The authors’ review of Prim’s social media postings and livestreams indicated that she had experienced significant trauma89 
        and appears to have been in crisis at the time of her arrest. In her apparent turmoil, it appears Prim latched on to <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span>, 
        especially its child sex trafficking ring conspiracy. In the livestream from the day of her arrest, she repeatedly claimed 
        that she cannot sit at home while children are suffering in her view because of former Vice President Joe Biden and 
        <span class="mention person" >Hillary Clinton</span>.90 It is highly likely that <span class="mention concept" >QAnon Conspiracy</span> theories radicalized her to an apparent desire to commit 
        violence, in light of the trauma that made her vulnerable.
    </p>
    
    <p class="article-p">
        Less than three weeks elapsed between Prim’s first <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> post and her arrest. In this brief period, Prim went from watching 
        online child trafficking conspiracy documentaries to offline violence-threatening behavior. Prim is a fascinating case 
        study of how ideologically motivated violent extremist communities and ideologies can radicalize vulnerable individuals. 
        The COVID-19 pandemic has shown that conspiracy theories and fringe movements are especially dangerous in times of social 
        upheaval and could pose a public security threat.91
    </p>

    <h3 class="article-section">Conclusion</h3>
    <p class="article-p">
        In this article, the authors have sought to contextualize <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> ideology and its role in radicalizing several individuals 
        to alleged high-profile criminal or violent acts. The recent case of Jessica Prim, on which the authors present original data, 
        particularly evinces the role the <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> ecosystem may play in radicalizing uniquely vulnerable individuals with experiences of 
        trauma or mental illness and the consequent threat <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> could pose to public security.
    </p>

    <p class="article-p">
        The February 19, 2020, Hanau, Germany, shisha bar attack by Tobias Rathjen is a recent example of how conspiracy theories 
        could play a role in radicalization to terrorist violence.92 According to a study of the attack in this publication by Blyth 
        Crawford and Florence Keen, conspiracy narratives “indicate that Rathjen was deeply entrenched within online conspiracy communities. 
        Drawing upon Barkun’s model of conspiracy belief, it is therefore possible to suggest that Rathjen was a supporter of a number 
        of isolated conspiracy theories, which, when compounded, may have influenced his broader sense of paranoia and anti-establishment 
        mindset.”93 The material consumed by Rathjen could possibly elucidate aspects of his radicalization, as the conspiracy theories 
        espoused by Rathjen and other conspiracy theories rely on the rejection of the mainstream explanation for their own and the 
        demonization of the other.94 As Crawford and Keen state, “this overlaps with online conspiracy communities suggests that the 
        influence of Rathjen’s attack may be felt in spheres beyond those traditionally associated with the far right.”95 Rathjen’s 
        deep involvement in online conspiracy theory communities and subsequent attack evinces the potential for future instances of 
        larger scale violence motivated by <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span>.
    </p>

    <p class="article-p">
        Moreover, <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> continues to gain traction in American popular culture. For example, <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> followers have recently 
        absurdly alleged on social media that Oprah Winfrey, Ellen DeGeneres, and other celebrities are under house arrest for 
        their participation in child sex trafficking rings. These posts have circulated widely online, with some celebrities even 
        responding to the allegations.96
    </p>

    <p class="article-p">
        <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> is not destined to remain on the periphery of political discourse either. CNN reported that former national security 
        adviser Michael Flynn posted a video on July 4, 2020, which showed him and a group repeating an oath of office before saying 
        the common <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> phrase, “Where we go one, we go all.” The post also included the hashtag #TakeTheOath, apparently referencing a 
        social media trend by <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> users from earlier in the week.97 Flynn’s lawyer Sidney Powell told The Washington Examiner, 
        “The slogan comes from an engraved bell on JFK’S sailboat—acknowledging the unity of mankind. The oath is obvious—the federal 
        oath in support of our Constitution. He wanted to encourage people to think about being a citizen. Don’t read anything 
        else into it.”98
    </p>

    <p class="article-p">
        Further, as reported by Alex Kaplan at Media Matters as well as in The New York Times,99 more than 60 candidates 
        who have run for Congress in 2020 appear to have expressed some degree of support for <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> (mostly Republicans and 
        Independents; two of the 66 were Democrats), and Marjorie Taylor Greene,i a <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> follower running for a Georgia seat 
        in the House of Representatives, is favored to win the Republican nomination as well as the general election.100 Jo Rae 
        Perkins, a <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> follower,j recently won the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate in Oregon, though she appears likely 
        to lose in the general election.101
    </p>

    <p class="article-p">
        Already, then, <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> supporters are trying to have an increased impact on mainstream discourse in the <span class="mention place" >United States</span>. 
        With this mainstreaming, as well as the impending presidential election that seems likely to only increase <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span>’s salience, 
        an increasing frequency of criminal or violent acts by <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> supporters seems possible, even likely.102 While the aforementioned 
        criminal acts seem largely motivated by <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span>, only Matthew Philip Wright has been charged with a terrorism offense. However, 
        the 2020 Hanau shisha bar attack presents one example of how conspiracy theories can help propel larger-scale terrorist attacks.103 
        If more individuals with greater organizational skills and operational acumen seek to pursue <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span>’s agenda, it could eventually 
        lead to more significant threats to public security and become a more impactful domestic terrorism threat, though this potential 
        development appears, at present, to be far on the horizon.
    </p>

    <p class="article-p">
        However, the threat to public security that <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> presents is not exclusive to the movement and the cases described above, 
        but rather, is representative of broader currents in the American information landscape. The increased consumption and 
        circulation of misinformation on social media, as well as its negative consequences, is evinced especially by <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span>, but 
        its effects on public safety are not limited to it. The emergence of future (related or unrelated) conspiracy theories 
        that may be effective at radicalizing individuals to terrorist violence should thus not be ruled out as threats to public security.
    </p>

    <p class="article-p">
        Regulation of <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> content by social media companies, activity which would be guided and governed by the adherence of 
        <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> supporters to respective platforms terms of service, may present one pathway to decreasing the likelihood of 
        individual radicalization to violence.104 This could operate similarly to Facebook and Twitter regulation of jihadi 
        content by the Islamic State and al-Qa`ida affiliates. On July 21, 2020, Twitter announced105 that it will be taking 
        action against <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> in light of “coordinated harmful activity.” Already Twitter has suspended 7,000 accounts and will 
        be limiting 150,000 more.106
    </p>

    <p class="article-p">
        However, regulation of <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> content could simply result in platform migration and further reinforce <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span>’s cosmology 
        that sees a cabal of pedophiles lurking behind every corporate or governmental decision.107 This is to be considered carefully, 
        based on the authors’ observation of <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> activity on Telegram, there is a growing overlap between <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> channels and more 
        extremist channels affiliated with the proud boys,108 paramilitary groups, and white supremacists.109 Additionally, the law 
        enforcement community and researchers need to consider the growing transnational dimensions of <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span>.110 <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> is arguably 
        no longer simply a fringe conspiracy theory but an ideology111 that has demonstrated its capacity to radicalize to violence 
        individuals at an alarming speed.     CTC
