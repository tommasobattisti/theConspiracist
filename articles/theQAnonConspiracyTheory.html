    <p class="article-p">
        The <span class="mention concept" >QAnon Conspiracy</span> theory, which emerged in 2017, has quickly risen to prominence in the <span class="mention place" >United States</span>. 
        A survey of cases of individuals who have allegedly or apparently been radicalized to criminal acts with a nexus to violence
        by <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span>, including one case that saw a guilty plea on a terrorism charge, makes clear that <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> represents a public security 
        threat with the potential in the future to become a more impactful domestic terror threat. This is true especially given that 
        conspiracy theories have a track record of propelling terrorist violence elsewhere in the West as well as <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span>’s more recent 
        influence on mainstream political discourse.
    </p>
    
    <p class="article-p">
        Generally speaking, law enforcement and public policy attention with respect to terrorism and political violence in North America tends to focus on jihadi or far-right extremism.<sup class='link-to-footnote reference' onclick='goToFootnote("1")'>1</sup> At first glance, QAnon, the bizarre assemblage of far-right conspiracy theories that holds that U.S. President Donald Trump is waging a secret war against an international cabal of satanic pedophiles seems to present a far lesser threat to public security. However, QAnon has contributed to the radicalization of several people to notable criminal acts or acts of violence. In light of these events, this article attempts to take stock of the violence this bizarre set of conspiracy theories has engendered thus far and asks whether it should be seen as a security threat in the making.<sup class='link-to-footnote reference' onclick='goToFootnote("2")'>2</sup>
    </p>
    <p class="article-p">
        Though less organized than jihadi or far-right extremists, the authors argue that QAnon represents a novel challenge to public security. This is consistent with a May 2019 report by the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation, which details the increasing influence of anti-government, identity-based, or fringe political conspiracies, including QAnon, on motivating criminal or violent activity. The report, as presented by Yahoo News, claims that “based on the increase volume and reach of conspiratorial content due to modern communication methods, it is logical to assume that more extremist-minded individuals will be exposed to potentially harmful conspiracy theories, accept ones that are favorable to their views, and possibly carry out criminal or violent actions as a result.”<sup class='link-to-footnote reference' onclick='goToFootnote("3")'>3</sup>
    </p>
    <p class="article-p">
        Further, the report emphasizes that the internet allows for a “crowd-sourcing” effect wherein “conspiracy theory followers themselves shape a given theory by presenting information that supplements, expands, or localizes its narrative.”<sup class='link-to-footnote reference' onclick='goToFootnote("4")'>4</sup> This effect appears particularly salient with QAnon, where followers are directed to take interpretation and action into their own hands, rather than at the explicit direction of the anonymous user (known only as Q) behind the movement. QAnon is thus markedly different from other far-right extremist groups and jihadi groups, as it lacks both a clear organizational structure and a centralization of interpretive duties.
    </p>
    <p class="article-p">
        In this article, the authors provide further context on the emergence of QAnon, a summary of five criminal cases with a nexus to violence motivated by QAnon, including one case that resulted in a guilty plea on a terrorism charge. The data presented here was collected by the authors from various sources from 2018 to the present, including QAnon community messaging pages, social media pages of individuals radicalized to criminal or violent activity, and publicly accessible news reports.

    <h3 class="article-section">What is the QAnon Conspiracy?</h3>
    <p class="article-p">
        The <span class="mention concept" >QAnon Conspiracy</span><sup class='link-to-footnote reference' onclick='goToFootnote("5")'>5</sup> emerged on Saturday, October 28, 2017, on <span class="mention keyword" >4chan</span>’s<sup class='link-to-footnote' onclick='goToFootnote("a")'>a</sup> /pol/ (politically incorrect page) 
        in a <span class="mention keyword" >thread</span>' called “Calm Before the Storm,” when an anonymous user signing off as ’<span class="mention person" >Q</span>’ stated that “<span class="mention person" >Hillary Clinton</span> 
        will be arrested between 7:45 AM – 8:30 AM EST on Monday – the morning on Oct 30, 2017.”<sup class='link-to-footnote reference' onclick='goToFootnote("6")'>6</sup> <span class="mention person" >Q</span>’s nom de plume is in reference 
        to ”<span class="mention person" >Q</span>” clearance, a clearance level in the <span class="mention place" >United States</span> Department of Energy.
    </p>
    
    <p class="article-p">
        However, <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> finds its origins a year prior in the <span class="mention concept" >Pizzagate</span> conspiracy theory,<sup class='link-to-footnote reference' onclick='goToFootnote("7")'>7</sup> which alleges 
        coded words and satanic symbolism purportedly apparent in <span class="mention person" >John Podesta</span>'’s emails, hacked during his tenure 
        as chair of <span class="mention person" >Hillary Clinton</span>’s <span class="mention event" >2016 U.S. presidential campaign</span>', point to a secret child sex trafficking ring 
        at a pizza restaurant in <span class="mention place" >Washington, D.C.</span>', called <span class="mention place" >Comet Ping Pong</span>. <span class="mention concept" >Pizzagate</span> came to a head in December 2016 
        when <span class="mention person" >Edgar M. Welch</span> (whose case is discussed in detail below) traveled from <span class="mention place" >North Carolina</span> “to the popular <span class="mention place" >DC</span> 
        pizzeria <span class="mention place" >Comet Ping Pong</span> with a handgun and an assault rifle to ‘self-investigate’ the validity of the <span class="mention keyword" >4chan</span> 
        conspiracy.”<sup class='link-to-footnote reference' onclick='goToFootnote("8")'>8</sup> <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span>, beginning in 2017, thus originated out of the <span class="mention concept" >Pizzagate</span> conspiracy theory, retaining the 
        central belief that a <span class="mention organization" >cabal of powerful elites</span>' control the world, using their power to covertly abuse children.
    </p>

    <p class="article-p">
        <span class="mention person" >Q</span>’s claim on <span class="mention keyword" >4chan</span> to have special government access and that he/she is part of a wider “<span class="mention concept" >anon genre</span>” of government 
        officials with top secret information is not entirely novel. Before <span class="mention person" >Q</span>, several <span class="mention keyword" >4chan</span> posters asserted they had special 
        government access, including <span class="mention person" >FBIAnon</span><sup class='link-to-footnote reference' onclick='goToFootnote("9")'>9</sup> and <span class="mention person" >HLIAnon</span><sup class='link-to-footnote reference' onclick='goToFootnote("10")'>10</sup> in 2016, and <span class="mention person" >CIAAnon</span><sup class='link-to-footnote reference' onclick='goToFootnote("11")'>11</sup> and <span class="mention person" >WHInsiderAnon</span><sup class='link-to-footnote reference' onclick='goToFootnote("12")'>12</sup> in 2017. <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> devotees, 
        many of whom may be familiar with this “<span class="mention concept" >anon genre</span>”, thus are familiar with <span class="mention person" >Q</span>’s apparent need for anonymity and presumably 
        take it as a sign of credibility.
    </p>

    <p class="article-p">
        In July 2020, nearly three years following <span class="mention person" >Q</span>'s emergence, there remains no consensus on who the original<span class="mention person" >Q</span>was and who 
        manages the account today. However, there is a fair amount of evidence that demonstrates how <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> grew to prominence 
        from the narrow confines of <span class="mention keyword" >4chan</span> and <span class="mention keyword" >8chan</span>'.<sup class='link-to-footnote' onclick='goToFootnote("b")'>b </sup> According to a 2018 <span class="mention organization" >NBC</span>' News investigative report, the original<span class="mention person" >Q</span>post 
        “would have gone mostly unnoticed if not for three people – <span class="mention person" >Tracy Diaz</span>', a YouTube vlogger, and <span class="mention keyword" >4chan</span> 
        moderators Pamphlet Anon, identified as <span class="mention person" >Coleman Rogers</span>', and <span class="mention person" >BaruchtheScribe</span>', a South African man named <span class="mention person" >Paul Furber</span>'.”<sup class='link-to-footnote reference' onclick='goToFootnote("13")'>13</sup> * <span class="mention organization" >NBC</span>' News reported 
        that <span class="mention person" >Rogers</span>' and <span class="mention person" >Furber</span>' reached out to <span class="mention person" >Diaz</span>', asking her to leverage her large YouTube following to promote the first ’<span class="mention person" >Q</span>’ posts.
        Without sharing the <span class="mention keyword" >4chan</span> <span class="mention keyword" >thread</span>' with <span class="mention person" >Diaz</span>'’ viewership, <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> may never have grown beyond its small following on the 
        image board site.
    </p>

    <p class="article-p">
        The authors have observed that QAnon supporters purport that their claims are empirical and do not ask that their 
        assertions be taken at face value. The <span class="mention organization" >QAnon community</span> is guided by the oft-repeated maxim, “<span class="mention concept" >do your own research</span>.”<sup class='link-to-footnote reference' onclick='goToFootnote("14")'>14</sup> 
        Imitating source citation and evidence presentation in academic scholarship, QAnon followers regularly engage in elaborate
        presentations of evidence to substantiate their claims. In this vein, they often self-identify as investigative journalists 
        or <span class="mention concept" >conspiracy researchers</span>'.<sup class='link-to-footnote reference' onclick='goToFootnote("15")'>15</sup>
    </p>

    <p class="article-p">
        <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> also represents a militant and anti-establishment ideology rooted in an apocalyptic desire to destroy the existing, 
        corrupt world to usher in a promised golden age.<sup class='link-to-footnote reference' onclick='goToFootnote("16")'>16</sup> This position finds resonance with other <span class="mention concept" >far-right</span> extremist movements, 
        such as the various militant, <span class="mention organization" >anti-government</span>, <span class="mention organization" >white nationalist</span>, and <span class="mention organization" >neo-Nazi</span> extremist organizations across the <span class="mention place" >United States</span>. 
        In February 2020, <span class="mention organization" >Omega Kingdom Ministries</span>, in effect a <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> church, was established in the <span class="mention place" >United States</span> and other countries where 
        the <span class="mention concept" >QAnon Conspiracy</span> acts as an interpretive lens for the Bible and vice versa, and in which adherents are subjected to formalized 
        religious indoctrination into <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span>.<sup class='link-to-footnote' onclick='goToFootnote("c")'>c</sup><span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> followers share roots with conspiracy theories that have fed other <span class="mention concept" >anti-government</span> 
        movements, such as the <span class="mention organization" >90s militias</span> that feared the “<span class="mention concept" >New World Order</span>”, or the <span class="mention concept" >anti-government apocalypticism</span> and religious fervor 
        of the <span class="mention organization" >Branch Davidians</span>.<sup class='link-to-footnote reference' onclick='goToFootnote("17")'>17</sup>
    </p>

    <p class="article-p">
        Recent criminal cases with a nexus to violence involving <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> followers show how <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> has contributed to the radicalization 
        of ideologically motivated violent extremists (IMVE).<sup class='link-to-footnote reference' onclick='goToFootnote("18")'>18</sup> According to the <span class="mention organization" >FBI</span>, <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> and other fringe conspiracy theories could “very likely motivate some domestic extremists, wholly or in part, to commit criminal and sometimes violent activity” and noted 
        that “one key assumption driving these assessments is that certain conspiracy theory narratives tacitly support or legitimize 
        violent action.”<sup class='link-to-footnote reference' onclick='goToFootnote("19")'>19</sup> Below, the authors provide a chronological summary of five criminal cases with a nexus to violence motivated, 
        in part at least, by <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> radicalization. They start with the aforementioned <span class="mention person" >Edgar Maddison Welch</span>, whose armed search of the 
        <span class="mention place" >Comet Ping Pong</span> pizzeria predated <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> but represents an ideological precursor to other <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span>-motivated actions.

    <p class="article-p">
        What stands out with this case is the rapidity with which <span class="mention person" >Prim</span> apparently radicalized to violence. From her first 
        contact with <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> propaganda, apparently on April 9, 2020—based on her Facebook posts, which the authors reviewed 
        in detail—20 days passed until she made threats of offline violence while in transit to <span class="mention place" >New York</span> City.
    </p>

    <p class="article-p">
        <span class="mention person" >Prim</span> first started posting about <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> in a closed Facebook group named <span class="mention organization" >Pizzagate Investigations Worldwide</span>. On April 9, 2020, 
        she replied to a post in the group, and on April 14, she shared the link to the <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> “documentary” Out of Shadows to the page. 
        Prior to April 9, 2020, there is no evidence <span class="mention person" >Prim</span> was familiar with or interacting with <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> content. Her social media feeds 
        from 2016 onward do not provide any evidence that she engaged with <span class="mention concept" >Pizzagate</span> conspiracy content, or the <span class="mention place" >Comet Ping Pong</span> 
        altercation in December 2016. The authors’ review of <span class="mention person" >Jessica Prim</span>’s social media postings found that she did not post regularly

    <p class="article-p">
        How did an individual who only recently discovered <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> apparently radicalize to violence so fast? Her hours of livestreams, 
        which are a rich source of personal information, suggest some possible answers. Radicalization is an individual process, and 
        as such, some anecdotes <span class="mention person" >Prim</span> recounts in her videos indicate what may have made her vulnerable to radicalization to 
        <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span>-related violence.
    </p>

    <p class="article-p">
        Since 2012, <span class="mention person" >Prim</span> has regularly posted content related to missing children, child abuse, and arrests of child abusers. 
        This is very likely central to her susceptibility to <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> narratives that feature a global sex-trafficking ring. Her

    <p class="article-p">
        It is unclear what caused <span class="mention person" >Prim</span> to spiral out of control in the twenty days preceding her arrest. One element, 
        however, emerges in a Facebook video she posted on April 28, 2020, at 12:35pm: her relationship with <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span>, she 
        stated in the video, began when one of her clients recommended she watch Fall of the Cabal, a <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> documentary 
        by Dutch conspiracy theorist Janet Ossebaard.<sup class='link-to-footnote reference' onclick='goToFootnote("84")'>84</sup> In this livestream, <span class="mention person" >Prim</span> claims this video motivated her to research

    <p class="article-p">
        Her sharing of the link to the <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> documentary Out of Shadows is consistent with this hypothesis, as the documentary

        <span class="mention person" >Prim</span> has posted about a wide range of related conspiracy theories regarding sex trafficking rings and the supposed <span class="mention organization" >Deep State

        and appears to have been in crisis at the time of her arrest. In her apparent turmoil, it appears <span class="mention person" >Prim</span> latched on to <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span>, 
        especially its child sex trafficking ring conspiracy. In the livestream from the day of her arrest, she repeatedly claimed

    <p class="article-p">
        Less than three weeks elapsed between <span class="mention person" >Prim</span>’s first <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> post and her arrest. In this brief period, <span class="mention person" >Prim</span> went from watching

        In this article, the authors have sought to contextualize <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> ideology and its role in radicalizing several individuals

        particularly evinces the role the <span class="mention organization" >QAnon</span> ecosystem may play in radicalizing uniquely vulnerable individuals with experiences of

        Drawing upon <span class="mention person" >Barkun</span>’s model of conspiracy belief, it is therefore possible to suggest that <span class="mention person" >Rathjen</span> was a supporter of a number

            dedicated to a liturgy where <span class="mention concept" >QAnon Conspiracy</span> theories are reinterpreted through the Bible. In the second hour,
