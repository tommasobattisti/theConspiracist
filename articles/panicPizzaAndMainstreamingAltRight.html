    <h2 class="artileSection">Abstract</h2>
    <p>The conspiracy theory known as ‘<span id="mention-3" class="mention concept theory" about="Pizzagate" data-label="Pizzagate">Pizzagate</span>’ gained a cult following on alt-right forums, ultimately prompting one believer to conduct a <span id="mention-4" class="mention event" about="shooting">shooting on the pizzeria</span> identified by online conspiracists. A thematic analysis of 767 tweets referencing <span id="mention-4" class="mention concept" about="Pizzagate" data-label="Pizzagate">Pizzagate</span> selected from five key intervention points in this timeframe reveals several factors influencing <span id="mention-6" class="mention concept" about="Pizzagate" data-label="Pizzagate">Pizzagate</span>’s continued appeal over a four-year period. The article examines how an online <span id="mention-7" class="mention concept" about="AltRight" data-label="alt-right">alt-right</span> conspiracy collective, <span id="mention-8" class="mention organisation movement" about="QAnon" data-label="QAnon" data-sort="QAnon">QAnon</span>, weaponized <span id="mention-9" class="mention concept" about="Pizzagate" data-label="Pizzagate">Pizzagate</span> as part of its overarching campaign to attract support for President <span id="mention-10" class="mention person" about="DonaldTrump" data-label="Donald Trump" data-sort="TrumpDonald">Donald Trump</span> and worked to establish the theory as a popular (albeit false) narrative within the contemporary political zeitgeist.</p>
    
    <h2 class="articleSection">Introduction</h2>
    
    <p>More than any other in United States history, the four-year electoral period following the <span id="mention-11" class="mention event" about="2016PresidentialElections" data-label="2016 presidential elections">2016 presidential election</span> has been characterized by a general rejection of the concept of objective facts. This <span id="mention-12" class="mention concept" about="PostTtruthCulture" data-label="post-truth culture">post-truth culture</span> has been spearheaded by President <span id="mention-13" class="mention person" about="DonaldTrump" data-label="Donald Trump" data-sort="TrumpDonald">Donald Trump</span>, a political outsider who has nevertheless been able to secure political success on a platform of questioning the motivations and actions of both the political establishment and the permanent civil service. While the <span id="mention-14" class="mention concept" about="AltRight" data-label="alt-right">alt-right</span> have propagated outlandish conspiracy theories targeting <span id="mention-15" class="mention person" about="DonaldTrump" data-label="Trump" data-sort="TrumpDonald">Trump</span>’s (often liberal) opponents since long before the <span id="mention-16" class="mention event" about="2016PresidentialElections" data-label="2016 presidential elections">2016 election</span>, there was surge in the acceptance of conspiratorial narratives online in the later years of the <span id="mention-17" class="mention event" about="TrumpPresidency" data-label="Trump presidency">Trump presidency</span>. Of particular note is the emergence of prominent anti-liberal narratives like <span id="mention-18" class="mention concept" about="Pizzagate" data-label="Pizzagate">Pizzagate</span>, a theory that emerged shortly before the <span id="mention-19" class="mention event" about="2016PresidentialElections" data-label="2016 presidential elections">2016 election</span> that suggested a cabal of <span id="mention-20" class="mention organisation" about="DemocraticParty" data-label="Democratic Party">Democratic Party</span> leaders including <span id="mention-21" class="mention person" about="HillaryClinton" data-label="Hillary Clinton" data-sort="ClintonHillary">Hillary Clinton</span> and campaign manager <span id="mention-22" class="mention person" about="JohnPodesta" data-label="John Podesta" data-sort="PodestaJohn">John Podesta</span> were involved in <span id="mention-23" class="mention event" about="Satanic ritual">ritual Satanic abuse</span> of children at a pizza parlour in <span id="mention-24" class="mention place" about="WashingtonDC" data-label="Whashington DC" data-sort="WashingtonDC">Washington, DC</span>. Beginning as just another fringe theory peddled on the internet by the <span id="mention-25" class="mention concept" about="AltRight" data-label="alt-right">alt-right</span>, <span id="mention-26" class="mention concept" about="Pizzagate" data-label="Pizzagate">Pizzagate</span> has proven particularly resistant to being debunked. A resurgence of interest in the <span id="mention-27" class="mention concept" about="Pizzagate" data-label="Pizzagate">Pizzagate</span> theory in early 2020 breathed new life into the general acceptance of <span id="mention-28" class="mention concept" about="Pizzagate" data-label="Pizzagate">Pizzagate</span>'s legitimacy, supported in part by the high-profile suicide of child sex trafficker <span id="mention-29" class="mention person" about="JeffreyEpstein" data-label="Jeffrey Epstein" data-sort="EpsteinJeffrey">Jeffrey Epstein</span> and his links to the political establishment (<span class="reference"><span id="mention-30" class="mention person referenced" about="GabrieleCosentino" data-label="gabriele Cosentino" data-sort="CosentinoGabriele">Cosentino</span>, 2020</span>). Most interestingly, it is no longer only the <span id="mention-31" class="mention concept" about="AltRight" data-label="alt-right">alt-right</span> or supporters of <span id="mention-32" class="mention person" about="DonaldTrump" data-label="Trump" data-sort="TrumpDonald">Donald Trump</span> who propagate the <span id="mention-33" class="mention concept" about="Pizzagate" data-label="Pizzagate">Pizzagate</span> myth. The <span id="mention-34" class="mention organisation movement">conspiracist movement</span> has grown beyond its niche origins, expanding into the discourse of the esoteric left as well as social media platforms popular with otherwise apolitical young people such as <span id="mention-35" class="mention thing" about="TikTok" data-label="TikTok">TikTok</span>.</p>
